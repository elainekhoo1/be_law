BUKIT MERTAJAM, Feb 2 (Bernama) -- A nasi kandar restaurant operator

Arson
KOTA BAHARU, Feb 5 (Bernama) -- The Kelantan Fire and Rescue Department
uncovered three cases of arson in the state last year, said its director
Abdul Ghani Daud.
He said the three suspected arson cases were in Tanah Merah involving a
supermarket, tyre shop and retail store, causing losses of some RM4
million.
""There were tell-tale signs that the fire in the three incidents was
the work of arsonists"", he told reporters at the department's Hari Raya
Aidil Fitri function here today.
Abdul Ghani said the other factor which pointed that the fire was not
accidental was that the owner had removed valuable items from the premises
before the fire started.
""One of the premises was located only about two km from the fire
station, however when firemen reached the schene, the building was already
totally razed,"" he said.
Abdul Ghani said 459 cases of fire was reported in the state last year
with losses amounting to some RM18 million. and Firemen managed to save
RM27 million worth of property during the same period.

"ARSON: SIBU POLICE GOING ALL OUT TO NAB PERPETRATORS
Police-Crimes
SIBU, April 5 (Bernama) - The police are leaving no stones unturned in
their efforts to track down those responsible for at least six attempted
cases of arson using petrol bombs and rocket flares.
This assurance was given by the Sibu District Police Chief, ACP
Sebastian Gaong, here this morning.
He had earlier briefed the Minister of Infrastructure Development and
Communications, Datuk Seri Wong Soon Koh, on the crime situation in the
town for the first three months of this year.
Also present were the Assistant Minister of Environment and Public
Health, Dr Soon Choon Teck, and Pelawan and Bukit Assek State Assemblymen,
Vincent Goh and Daniel Ngieng, respectively.
The cases reported occurred either late at night or in the early
mornings between December last year and now.
The most recent case was on March 30 when at 2.45am two unidentified
men fired two rocket flares at the senior officers' flats at the Customs
Housing area in Ria Road but missed their target.
""We are still investigating these cases from every angle. We will also
appreciate public information very much.""
Commenting on the discovery of a petrol bomb outside the compound of
the Central Police Station here about two weeks ago, Gaong denied it was
targetted at the station.
""It will take sheer guts as not less than 20 policemen were in the
building at the material time. Others were having drinks at a nearby
24-hour coffeeshop after an anti-crime operation from 10pm to 2am.
""The station building is only about 10 metres away from the main road,""
he said.
If it was really the intended target, the person concerned would have
had no problem in hurling it there, he said.
Gaong said the so-called bomb, a soft drink bottle filled with petrol
and a piece of cloth as its wick, looked more like an makeshift torch.
Meanwhile, he said between January and March this year, a total of 310
different criminal cases were reported, an increase of 48 cases, or 18.3
per cent, compared to the corresponding period last year.

"POLICE LAUDED FOR SWIFT ACTION IN CHURCH ARSON ATTACKS
CHURCH-POLICE
PETALING JAYA, Jan 8 (Bernama) -- The police have been commended for their
swift action in the three church arson attacks in the Klang Valley.
Reverend Phiilip (rpt) Phiilip Muthu, chief priest of the Assumption Church
here, one of the churches fire-bombed, said he called Inspector General of
Police (IGP) Tan Sri Musa Hassan after the incident took place and the police
chief responded immediately.
""This morning, as soon as the incident happened, I called the IGP and he
immediately referred me to the 'balai' (Petaling Jaya police headquarters).
""The policemen there were very helpful and cooperative. They came very fast
and there was a thorough investigation by them,"" he said, and expressed his
thanks to the police.
The church did not suffer damage because the molotov cocktail which was
hurled onto the pavement in front of the church did not explode, he said.
Rev Muthu said he hoped that the police and government would step up
security for churches and other places of worship.
He said he was a bit concerned because about 6,000 worshippers had attended
Sunday mass there.
Minister in the Prime Minister's Department Tan Sri Dr Koh Tsu Koon, who
visited the church, was also pleased with the police response and credited them
for a good job done.
The National Evangelical Christian Fellowship (NECF) Malaysia also praised
the police and the fire and rescue department.
""Though, to date, no casualties have been reported, we want to commend the
swift action taken by both the police and the fire and rescue department.
""We hope that with adequate investigations, they will be able to probe the
blaze and speedily bring those responsible to justice,"" it said in a statement.
Besides the Assumption Church, the Life Chapel, also in Petaling Jaya, and
the Metro Tabernacle Church in Desa Melawati, Kuala Lumpur, were fire-bombed.
Only the molotov cocktail hurled at the Metro Tabernacle Church exploded,
sparking a fire.
In SHAH ALAM, Selangor CID deputy chief ACP Omar Mammah said police
recovered pieces of broken bottle and gauze bandage used as the wick for the
molotov cocktails hurled at the Petaling Jaya churches.
He said police conducted patrols at all houses of worship in the area to
prevent further incidents.

the teachings of one's own religion as all religions preach to the followers to
do good.
Condemning the action of hurling home-made bombs at three churches in the
Klang Valley by unknown individuals late yesterday and early today, Rais said
extremists like these should not exist in a plural society like Malaysia.
He said the action was against Islamic teachings which enjoined Muslims to
do good, to live in harmony and to respect one another.
""All societies disapprove such action,"" he said after visiting the Tun Abdul

hostel at Angkasapuri, here, today.
He urged Malaysians to face the problem together and act fast to end it.
""If not, Malaysia will earn a bad name in the world as having an intolerant
society.
""It's sad that this (church arson) has happened and we need to create
awareness. Malaysia cannot afford to have such destructive elements,"" he said.
Rais also urged the people to report to the police immediately if they knew

Earlier, Rais said he wanted IPPTAR to play a more important role in
training to produce quality television and radio announcers, programme hosts and
news readers in terms of language proficiency and delivery.
He said the recruitment procedure should also be tightened to get the best
talents, besides providing adequate training.

"POLICE BELIEVE MORE THAN TWO SUSPECTS INVOLVED IN CHURCH ARSON

KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 8 (Bernama) -- Police believe more than two suspects were
involved in setting a church on fire in Desa Melawati, Wangsa Maju about 12
midnight (Thursday) said Kuala Lumpur Police Chief Datuk Wira Muhammad Sabtu
Osman.
Wira said based on information, witnesses saw two motorcycles parked near
the church around midnight and witnesses also saw images of someone hurling
something towards the three-storey church before an explosion destroyed about 80
per cent of the ground floor which housed the administration office.
""Initial investigations reveal that the suspects had broken all the glass
window panels in the ground floor of the building before pouring what was
believed to be petrol, into the building.
""We believe they used a spanner for breaking the glass panels because police
found a spanner and petrol container at the scene plus two burnt helmets in
front of the church,"" he told reporters here today.
He said police have yet to determine the motive for the attack on the church
but did not rule out the possibility that the incident was related to the High
Court's decision to allow the word ""Allah"" to be used by the publisher of the
Catholic Weekly-The Herald.
Wira also urged the public to refrain from issuing any statements or
comments because any reaction may cause racial sentiments.
About 1,500 Christians are believed to frequent the 12-year-old Metro
Tabernacle Church for their church activities.
Meanwhile, about 30 church-goers started removing whatever equipment that
was salvaged from the fire, when police removed the restriction barriers.

church arson attempt involving the Good Shepherd Lutheran Church in Jalan

However, police believe this incident happened about the same time as the

Home Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Tun Hussein, who confirmed the latest

investigations.
""The spreading of SMSes that there were more arson attempts on churches
today are not true.
""Don't be easily taken in by the SMSes you receive,"" he told reporters after

"AIRPORT ARSON: DECISION ON APPEAL IN TWO WEEKS
Court-Arson
KUALA LUMPUR, April 11 (Bernama) -- Former air traffic controller
Johari Saaid, convicted and sentenced to 10 years' jail for arson at the
airport in Subang, will know the outcome of his appeal in about two weeks.
High Court judge Datuk Kang Hwee Gee said this after hearing
submissions from Johari's counsel K. Balaguru and deputy public prosecutor
Siti Salwa Musa.
Johari was convicted by the Sessions Court in Petaling Jaya in 1996
after being found guilty of setting fire and destroying the tower at
Terminal One of the Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport, then known as the Kuala
Lumpur International Airport, at 5.15am on Oct 15, 1992.
Balaguru, in his submissions, said Johari should not have been called
to enter his defence as the entire evidence adduced in the trial was not
cogent enough to convict him.
He disputed the dates given by a a shop assistant in Pekan Subang who
testified that he sold kerosene to Johari on two occasions prior to the
fire.
The court was told that the fire was caused either by kerosene or jet
fuel but the chemist was inconclusive as to which liquid was used as both
had similar compositions.
Balaguru said the duty roster showed Johari was on leave for two days
beginning Oct 5, the date he allegedly bought kerosene for the first time.
He said another prosecution witness testified Johari would normally go
back to his home in Penang whenever he was not on duty.
No evidence was adduced to indicate that Johari was in Kuala Lumpur on
Oct 5, he said.
Balaguru said the evidence by the shop assistant that Johari bought
kerosene from the shop a second time on Oct 13 (two days before the fire)
should also be rejected.
Balaguru said Johari could not have bought the kerosene on that date
because the duty roster showed that he was working from 1.30pm on Oct 13
until 7.30am the next morning.
He said the lack of investigation by the police to determine whether
Johari was in Kuala Lumpur on Oct 13 should not make Johari accountable for
the airport fire.
He added that there was evidence that anybody could have the
opportunity to gain access to the surau (prayer room), where the fire
started, as there was no security guard.
However, Siti Salwa submitted that evidence showed that the place where
the fire started was a restricted area and could not be easily entered.
She said although Johari was working on Oct 13, he still had the
opportunity to buy the kerosene before 1.30pm, adding that there was also a
break in between in his working hours.
Siti Salwa said there was no evidence that Johari went back to Penang
on Oct 5 and if it was true, he (Johari) could have asked his wife to
testify that he was at home with her on that day which he did not.

COURT-CHURCH
KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 13 (Bernama) -- The Sessions Court here sentenced two
brothers to five years' jail each after finding them guilty of torching a
church in Desa Melawati early this year.
Judge S.M. Komathy Suppiah meted out the sentence on despatch rider Raja
Mohamad Faizal Raja Ibrahim, 24, and his brother Raja Mohamad Izham, 22, a bank
employee, after ruling that they had failed to raise reasonable doubts in their
defence against the charge.
They were charged along with several others who are still at large, with
causing mischief by fire by torching the Metro Tabernacle Church at Jalan 4/4c,
Desa Melawati at 11.50pm on Jan 7 this year.
The charge under Section 436, read together with Section 34 of the same Code,
carries a maximum jail of 20 years and fine upon conviction.
On July 30, their friend Azuwan Shah Ahmad, 23, who was jointly charge with
committing the offence, was acquitted and discharged without his defence being
called.
Komathy, however, granted a stay of execution of the sentence pending an appeal
and allowed them a bail of RM20,000 each.
Komathy, who described arson attacks on places of worship ""egregious and
reprehensible"", said the court was duty-bound to ensure that a deterrent
custodial sentence was imposed on offenders who desecrate religion or religious
beliefs, to ensure peace and harmony in a multi-racial country like Malaysia.
""The imposition of lenient sentence would not send a strong and clear message
that this kind of offence would not be tolerated and condoned,"" she said.
She also said that it was fortunate that the police were able to maintain law
and order ""despite your actions which were inflammatory in more ways than one.""
Komathy said however that in passing the sentence, she was mindful of the fact
that they both were young and had no criminal record.
""It is painful when a young person is required to be incarcerated but for
offences such as the present one, considerations of compassion must yield to
those of public interest.
""The massage from this court must be loud and clear -- 'don't play with
fire',"" she said.
In mitigation, Datuk Hanif Hashim, representing both accused, urged the
court to impose a lenient sentence because it was their first offence and that
they need to look after their family.
Deputy Public Prosecutor Lailawati Ali objected and said that they should
have thought about their family prior to engaging in such act, which she said
could threaten public order.
A total of 24 prosecution and four defence witnesses testified in the trial
which started in January.

A witness who did not want to be identified said three men carrying two
containers believed to be filled with petrol broke into the shop through
its front door at about 1.25am.
He claimed there were two explosions from the premises shortly after

Police later found the containers which smelt of petrol and some lumps
of cloth.
Two fire engines from Klang North and Klang South fire stations with 15
firemen arrived at the scene at 1.53am and took about 30 minutes to put out
the blaze.
The quick action by the firemen prevented the fire from spreading to
adjoining premises and the upper floors of the five-storey building.
Klang Fire and Rescue Service Assistant Operations Officer Ismail Wahid
said the cause of the fire was being investigated.
Klang OCPD ACP Md Jamil Ayub confirmed receiving a report on the
alleged arson incident and said police would investigate the motive.
He said the case would be investigated under Section 435 of the Penal
Code for causing mischief with fire or explosives with the intention of

gain access to the Air Traffic Control Centre (ATCC) where the fire started
through two staircases located at the ground floor near to the Telekom
Malaysia Berhad's office.
He said that although certain staff were not authorised to enter the
centre, they could do so as there were no physical barriers (walls) and
security guards stationed at the two staircases.
Ahmad Tarmizi said that certain staff were issued with different
category of security passes which limited them to moving around their work
places and others were given security passess which permitted them to enter
the ATCC.
He said officially all ATCC staff and others should use the staff
entrance to enter the ATCC where security guards were stationed for
inspection.
Ahmad Tarmizi said the two staircases could lead any staff to the ATCC
including personnel from Telekom Malaysia and the runway as there were no
fence separating the runway and the lower concourse level of the building
measuring 2.2 metres.
He also said that he had visited the ATCC after the fire occurred with
investigating officer Hanafiah Mohamed Noor, firemen, personnel from the
Department of Civil Aviation and the police.
He however said no one could enter the ATCC through the duty free shop
area because the centres were separated by a wall. -- Bernama

Thailand-South
BANGKOK, Jan 19 (Bernama) -- The Thai authorities today used
helicopters to distribute thousands of leaflets appealing to the people to
help them nab culprits involved in the school arson attacks in the three
restive southern provinces.
The leaflets, printed in Thai and southern Malay language, asked the
cooperation of the southerners to help stop the torching down of schools as
it would destroy the future of their children.
Blaming criminals for the arson attacks, the authorities said the group
was creating chaos in local villages without any concern for the welfare
and future of young generations.
It was distributed by the Director's Office of Region Four Internal
Peace Security and the army, which also put similar notes on Jan 8 to
appeal for protection against teachers who are among the main target of
militants.
for security personnel to enter many villages in the south due to planted
road side bombs targeted at them.
The Thai Education Ministry said more than 110 schools were burned and
72 school teachers, administrators and other staff have been killed by
suspected militants since the attack on an army camp in Narathiwat on Jan
4, 2004.
Close to 2,000 people have died in Yala, Pattani and Narathiwat and
nearby Songkhla province as militants renewed their war against the central
government after the army camp raid to seek independence for the
Muslim-majority provinces.
Although teachers were escorted to and from schools by security forces
in many parts of the border provinces, they have been targeted by
separatists, and many have been gunned down while travelling alone,
including four this month.
According to official figures, there are about 11,200 teachers teaching
more than 291,300 students in 861 schools in the three provinces.
But school arson is not limited to the south alone as politically
motivated arson attacks have been blamed for 45 school fires nationwide
since the military staged a coup on Sept 19, 2006 that ousted Prime
Minister Thaksin Shinawatra.

POLICE-CHURCH
KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 20 (Bernama) -- Police have arrested eight men, among them two
brothers and their uncle, in connection with the arson attack at the Metro
Tabernacle Church in Desa Melawati on Jan 8.
All of them, aged between 21 and 26 years, were held at several locations in
the Klang Valley between yesterday afternoon and this morning, said Bukit Aman
CID director Datuk Seri Mohd Bakri Mohd Zinin said today.
""They are being remanded for seven days from today to help in the investigation
into the case under Section 436 of the Penal Code which carries a maximum jail
term of 20 years upon conviction,"" he told reporters at the Kuala Lumpur police
headquarters, here.
Section 436 provides for the jail term and a fine for causing mischief by fire
or explosive substance with intent to destroy any building.
Mohd Bakri said the first suspect, a 25-year-old despatch rider, was arrested
at 3.30pm yesterday at the Kuala Lumpur Hospital when seeking treatment for
burns on his chest and hands.
His arrest led to the arrests of the seven others at various locations in the
Ampang area, he said.
One of them is the despatch rider's younger brother, aged 24, and another is
their uncle, aged 26, while the rest are their friends, he added.
He also said that the younger brother of the despatch rider had also suffered
burns, on his left hand, apparently from the arson attack.
All the eight suspects held jobs with private firms, employed in various

case of the arson attack at the Metro Tabernacle Church had been solved.
The police had set up a special investigation team following the arson
attack at the Metro Tabernacle Church and several other churches in the Klang
Valley.
The attacks had come in the wake of a High Court ruling on Dec 31 allowing
the Catholic weekly magazine, Herald, to use of the word ""Allah"" (God) in its
publications. The court subsequently allowed a stay of execution pending an
appeal against the decision by the Home Ministry.
Mohd Bakri said Bukit Aman police had worked with Kuala Lumpur police in
solving the Metro Tabernacle Church arson attack case and added that the police
did not find any link between those arrested and the arson attacks on other
churches in the Klang Valley.
""We ask the people to remain calm and allow the police to conduct their
investigation to enable us to send our papers to the attorney-general for
subsequent action.

THAILAND-ARSON
BANGKOK, May 20 (Bernama) -- Bangkok was hit by more than 34 arson attacks
overnight in the aftermath of yesterday's military operations to reclaim the
city centre from anti-government protesters.
Bangkok Metropolitan Administration said the attacks targeted shopping
complexes, hotels, supermarkets, convenient stores, cinemas and a television
station.
Several houses in the capital have also been set ablaze, sending jitters
through the battered city.
Even the curfew, imposed between 8pm last night and 6am today, failed to
stop the burning, which badly damaged a hotel in Din Daeng and a supermarket in
Rajdamri as protesters began torching buildings immediately after Red Shirt
leaders surrendered and declared the end of protest at 2pm yesterday.
Among the worst hit buildings is CentralWorld, the biggest shopping complex
in Southeast Asia.
Parts of the Stock Exchange of Thailand building were also on fire
yesterday, forcing the suspension of trading today.
The Centre for Resolution of the Emergency Situation (CRES) described the
attacks as terrorism acts and warned that those caught could be sentenced to
death.
Hardcore Red Shirt protesters who were not satisfied with the end of rally
and the surrender of their leaders, resorted to looting shopping complexes and
setting them ablaze.
Apart from the CentralWorld, other luxurious shopping complexes which also
became the targets were Siam Square and Siam Paragon.
A police general hospital, located behind CentralWorld, has evacuated its
patients for fear that the shopping complex might collapse.
All local and foreign banks and financial institution in the capital
remained closed today.
Outside Bangkok, provinces such as Chiangmai, Khon Kaen, Ubon Ratchatani,
Udon Thani and Mukdaharn also experienced arson attacks last night, targeting
city hall buildings.
Official figure puts the number of death in yesterday's crackdown to seven,
bringing the death toll to 44 in the seven-day battle.
A total of 384 others were injured in the clash, a culmination of 10-week
protests, which started on March 12, mounted by anti-government protesters
demanding the dissolution of Parliament.
The protest ended yesterday after security forces reclaimed the city centre.
The long drawn-out protest hit the country's economy and tourism sector
hard, with the Macro Economic Policy Office saying the crisis had set back the
country's economic growth by more than 0.5 per cent.
The Board of Trade of Thailand said the crisis caused losses amounting to
500 billion Baht and that it would take a month to recover from the mess and at
least six more months to restore confidence in Thailand, the second largest
economy in Southeast Asia after Indonesia.
Tourist arrivals have dwindled by two-third, to 10,000 a day from the
previous 30,000.

MIRI, Feb 21 (Bernama) -- The Sessions Court here today sentenced two
Indonesian workers to three years' jail each for committing arson on an oil
palm estate in Nyalau, Niah, about 150km from here, last year.
Jalaludin Ibrahim, 24, and Marhan Mahsor, 28, pleaded guilty to
committing mischief by fire with intent to destroy the office building of
Majrany Oil Plam Plantation on Nov 5 last year.
They were charged under section 436 of the Penal Code, which carries a
maximum 20 years jail or a fine, upon conviction.
Sixty-six others pleaded not guilty but the charges against them were
withdrawn, with the prosecution finding no concrete evidence of them
actually setting the building on fire.
ASP Anthony Abell also withdrew a charge against all the 68 of rioting
at the plantation office before the arson.
Judge Timothy Finlayson Joel, in passing sentence on Jalaludin and
Mahsor, took into account their guilty plea, facts of the case, nature of
offence, losses suffered by the company and public interest as well as the
mitigating factors.
He said there were several meetings between the accused together with
other colleagues and the company management about the claimed wages that
had not been paid to them.
They had wanted to go back to Indonesia to celebrate Hari Raya and
seize the opportunity before the expiry of the amnesty period granted by
the Malaysian government to illegal foreign wokers.
Counsel William Ding represented all the workers through the Indonesian
Consulate General Office in Sarawak.
In mitigation, he said the surrounding circumstances as well as the
uncompromising attitude shown by the palntation company had given rise to

COURT-UM
KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 24 (Bernama) -- The Sessions Court here discharged and
acquitted five University of Malaya (UM) students accused of arson and
trespassing in June last year without their defence being called.
Judge Rozana Ali Yusuff said the court found that the prosecution had failed
to established a prima facie case against the five students of Islamic Studies
Academy Faculty -- Mohamad Izzuddin Hilmi, 22, Muhammad Syahrul Denn Ahmad
Rosli, 22, Mohamad Aizat Rosle, 22, Mohammad Saufi Jelani, 22, and Mohd Shazni
Munir Mohd Ithnin, 23.
In her judgment, Rozana said the prosecution failed to prove that the five
had committed mischief by fire as there were no evidence which identified the
flammable material used in the alleged arson.
""It was not proven whether the material used was petrol or whether the
scribbling marks on the wall of the premises were made by the students,"" she
said.
The five were charged with attempting to commit mischief by fire by pouring
petrol on a carpet as well as trespassing and defacing the wall of the main hall
of the faculty.
Rozana also said that there were no direct evidence to show that the
students were in the area at the time of the incident.
Nineteen prosecution witnesses were called during the trial.

The court ordered Johari, 44, to serve the sentence from today.
The sentence was stayed on Johari's application pending an appeal he

Johari was convicted on ""circumstantial evidence"" of causing mischief
by setting fire to the tower at Terminal One of the airport at about 5.15am

He was charged under Section 436 of the Penal Code which provides for a
maximum sentence of 20 years jail or fine or both on conviction.
Judge Mat Zaraai Alias said during sentencing that he had considered
public interest and wanted to convey a warning to others not to commit a
similar offence.
He said the offence by Johari was serious as it crippled civil aviation
and created an unfavourable image of the country.
Johari showed no outward emotion when sentence was imposed but his wife

"Five killed in suspected arson
Source:New Straits Times
IPOH: Five people, including a 91-year-old man, were killed in a fire at
a double-storey house. Arson is suspected.
Neighbours saw a man alighting from a car and throwing something into
the porch.
The car sped off before a series of explosions had the house on fire
within seconds.
Initial investigations by a police forensics team indicated that the
fire started outside the home in Taman Song Choon here.
House owner Chai Chee Keong, 33, was pulled out of the house through
the kitchen window by neighbours and has been admitted to Ipoh Hospital
with burns on the arms.
The dead were Chai Kim, 91, his son Chai Kar It, 67, his grand-daughter
Chai Mooi Fong, 32, her husband Tan Wei Lim, 32, and a relative Lim Tian
Hua, 29.
In the 3.30am incident, Chee Keong was sleeping in the hall with his
grandfather Chai Kim, when they were awakened by intense heat.
Chee Keong, who rushed to the kitchen to get water to put out the
flames, was unable to return to the hall as the fire spread quickly and
his shouts for help brought the neighbours.
The neighbours broke the kitchen window and pulled him out. Chai Kim
and the others who were on the first floor could not be saved as the
house was quickly engulfed in flames.
The bodies of Mooi Fong and Wei Lim were found in the master bedroom
upstairs while Kar It and Tian Hua were found dead in two bathrooms.
A neighbour, who declined to be identified, said he and several people
saw a white Perodua Kancil stop in front of the house and speeding away
after a man was seen throwing something into the porch.
""There were several explosions and the fire spread.""
The fire also damaged three houses nearby.
""We heard the victims screaming for help for several minutes but the
fire spread too rapidly for us to do anything,"" said a neighbour who
wanted to be known only as Lim.
Security guard P. Gunasegaran, 39, who helped pull Chee Keong out
through the window, said he was on his rounds at a nearby housing estate
when he noticed the fire.
""The fire was burning in the front portion of the house, so I rushed to
the back and used my helmet to smash the kitchen window.
""We pulled him out with the help of others,"" he said.
Chee Keong owns an orchard in Cameron Highlands and is believed to have
driven home the previous night to take Chai Kim for a coronary check-up.
Wei Lim's father, Tan Bin Keong, said a relative had been harassing one
of the family members following a recent divorce.
""I was told that the relative had been abusive and threatening,"" he
said when met at the mortuary in Ipoh Hospital.
Firemen took 30 minutes to bring the fire under control. Two cars and a
motorcycle parked in the porch of the house were also destroyed.
The police forensics team is expected to complete its investigations
and submit a report in a week.

"Underage maid arrested for arson
KUALA TERENGGANU: A 14-year-old Indonesian maid was detained for torching
her employer's house in Taman Murni, Seberang Takir, here, yesterday.
The maid, from Palembang, was believed to have set fire to the bedroom
and the kitchen before fleeing to the Kuala Terengganu bus terminal with
two laptop computers and RM500 belonging to Intan Zuhaida Abdul Wahab, 40.
Intan said she left the house at 9.15am to attend a function at Sekolah
Menengah Sultan Sulaiman with her 13-year-old daughter.
She said she rushed home after her husband, Mazli Mohamad, 49, called
her at 10.30am to inform her that their house was on fire.
""I was shocked to discover that my daughter's bedroom and part of the
kitchen had been destroyed by the fire.
""I suspected something amiss as (the maid) was nowhere to be seen.""
Intan said the maid was supposed to be sent back to Indonesia on
Saturday and was put up at her house to wait for her departure.
The maid had been working for Zulkarnain Abdul Wahab, who decided to
send her back after discovering her real age.
She had claimed to be 18 when she applied to an agency.
""Zulkarnain put her up at my house after he discovered that she was
actually 14, not 18. We treated her like our own daughter as she is just a
kid,"" said Intan.
The girl was trying to buy a ticket to Kuala Lumpur when Zulkarnain
caught up with her at the bus station here.
Zulkarnain brought her to the Gong Badak police station where she was
detained for mischief by fire with intent to destroy a house and theft.
Intan said her losses in the fire were estimated at RM30,000.
State Fire and Rescue Department public relations officer Kamla Mohd Tan
said 25 firemen in three engines were despatched to the scene after they
received a distress call at 10.40am.
However, Intan's neighbours had already managed to put out the blaze by
the time the firemen arrived.

"DOE office fire in JB: It WAS arson
Source:New Straits Times
KUALA LUMPUR, Mon. - Arsonists were behind the fire that destroyed many
files at the Department of Environment in Johor in March.
Police will now get involved in the probe - just the latest cloud
hanging over the department, which has been beset with accusations of
patchy enforcement and wrongdoing.
Fire and Rescue Department deputy Director-General Datuk Wan Mohd Nor
Ibrahim said that investigators were now trying to find out what caused
the fire.
After the March 24 blaze, the New Straits Times reported that the fire
may have been the work of arsonists who wanted to destroy sensitive files.
The fire broke out in a storage facility where files on DOE
investigations into the illegal storage and dumping of toxic waste in the
State were kept. The DOE later said that all the files destroyed in the
fire were old files.
As such, there would be minimal effect on ongoing investigations into
the illegal storage of toxic waste.
Meanwhile, Deputy Natural Resources and Environment Minister Datuk S.
Sothinathan said, ""We want to get the culprits as soon as possible.""
He said the department had lodged a report after the March fire.
""Since we have lodged a report, I think the police should now pursue
the investigation based on findings by the Fire and Rescue Department,""
he said.
The fire took place against the backdrop of a probe by the
Anti-Corruption Agency into the enforcement of environmental laws and the
importing of toxic waste.

"`Abuse' reason for arson
KUALA TERENGGANU: She had come to Malaysia to work as a maid, but
apparently had found housework and other daily chores to be ""abusive"".
That was the reason the Indonesian maid torched the kitchen and a
bedroom of her employer's house on Wednesday.
The employer, Intan Zuhaida Abdul Wahab, said the maid, whose real age
is unknown, had confessed to her that she had set fire to the house as
retribution for the ""abuse"".
The maid fled the scene after starting the blaze, with two laptop
computers and RM500 cash.
""She said it was retribution because we had abused her.
""I was flabbergasted when she told me that having to do housework was
viewed as a form of abuse to her.
""She had been clamouring to go back to Indonesia as soon as possible as
she said she wanted to work in a beauty salon in Singapore.
""She had been promised the Singapore job by an unknown party,"" said
Intan Zuhaida.
Police are still trying to figure out the actual age of the maid as her
passport stated that she was 22 years old, although she had initially told
her employers that she was 18 but later claimed that she was just 14.
State Criminal Investigation Department chief Assistant Commissioner
Mohd Fauzi Abduri said her correct age was pertinent to the investigations
as she had made several different claims about it.
Indonesian embassy Minister Counselor (Information, Social and Culture)
Widyarka Ryananto said the embassy would provide legal assistance to the
maid.
""We have contacted the Malaysian police and the also relevant
departments in Indonesia to get further details about the girl.""
Widyarka said the embassy was also trying to find out which agency had
sent her here.
""We respect the Malaysian law and will allow the authorities here
proceed with their investigations into the case,"" he said.
""We will provide her with legal assistance as she is innocent until
proven guilty in court.""
Widyarka said his officers would interview the maid as soon as they are
given the go-ahead from Terengganu police.

"Arson ruled out in Gat Lebuh Noordin blaze
Source:New Straits Times
PENANG, Wed. - The authorities have not detected any foul play in the fire
which gutted about 50 houses and left more than 500 people homeless in the
Gat Lebuh Noordin foreshore settlement here yesterday morning.
""Our investigations so far have revealed no criminal elements pertaining
to the cause of the fire,"" said North East District criminal
investigations chief, acting Superintendent Hasnan Hassan.
He said the probe by police and the Fire and Rescue Department revealed
that the fire had started in one of five houses numbered between 71 and
75, at the edge of the fore-shore settlement.
""We have found no criminal evidence that can affirm suspicion that the
fire was caused by arsonists,"" he said, when asked about widespread
rumours that arson was the cause of the pre-dawn blaze.
Two children, identified as Anatasha Mardiana Abdul Rani, three, and
Alwani Zulaika, two, died while four others were injured.
State forensic pathologist Dr Bhupinder Singh, who conducted a post
mortem on the children, said they died from severe burns.
The children had been left on their own in a locked room by their
mother, Umi Kalsum Harun, 38, who had gone out to buy some food at about
3.30am.
Resident Lim Chwee Soon, 39, said today neighbours had heard Umi Kalsum
calling for help just as the fire broke out at the house where she rented
a room.
""A few of us heard her children crying and tried to rescue them, but we
could not enter the locked room in the house which was in darkness and
engulfed in thick smoke,"" said Lim, who is the son of the village head-
man.
""To make matters worse, the children's mother had followed us into the
house and we had to carry her out as she was pregnant and was overcome by
the smoke,"" he said.
""By the time we returned to the house with the firefighters who had
arrived by then, there were no more cries from the room,"" said Lim, adding
that a strong wind had fanned the flames which rapidly spread to other
houses.
Lim also dispelled rumours that villagers had seen a suspected arsonist
flee as the fire started in the house where Umi Kalsum's children were
trapped.
Meanwhile, at the fire relief centre in Gat Lebuh Macallum, many victims
were still in a state of shock over their loss.
A 50-year-old garbage truck driver, V. Gunasegaran and his 47-year-old
wife M. Chandrani, who were both away at their daughter's house when the
blaze razed their home, could not believe that they had lost all they
owned.
""We only knew about the fire late last night when one of our neighbours
called our daughter's home in Butterworth.
""I am so frustrated that we lost all our belongings including cash,
jewellery worth RM5,000, and furniture that we have kept for years, within
a few minutes,"" said Gunasegaran.
Meanwhile, State DAP Action Team deputy chief Tham Weng Fatt urged the
State Government to place more emphasis on safety measures for residents
of Pengkalan Weld, especially those in the foreshore area.
Tham suggested that a committee be set up to monitor and prevent such
mishaps from recurring.

"Arson ruled out, probe focuses on negligence
Source:New Straits Times
KUALA LUMPUR, Fri. - The Fire and Rescue Department is investigating
whether human negligence was the cause of a fire which destroyed about 100
houses and left over 500 people homeless in Kampung Datuk Keramat
yesterday.
Its public relations officer, Charles Gomes, said today initial
investigations revealed the fire had started from one of the houses.
""However, the department has ruled out arson as the cause of the blaze,""
he added.
In yesterday's three-hour blaze, which broke out at 11.15am, 513 people,
including Indonesian immigrants, were made homeless.
The victims were provided temporary shelter at the Datuk Keramat
multi-purpose hall.
Thirty firemen from the central Fire and Rescue Department at Jalan Hang
Tuah and the Ampang fire station, assisted by members of the Civil Defence
Department, were at the scene.
The firemen's efforts to fight the fire were initially hampered by low
water pressure.
However, they managed to bring it under control about an hour later,
preventing the fire from spreading to nearby structures.
Asked to comment on the low water pressure, Gomes said the newly-formed
Federal Territory Fire and Rescue Department Squatters Safety Committee
would look into it and ascertain if there were enough fire hydrants in the
area.
On Feb 21, the committee was set up to monitor and identify fire-prone
squatter settlements in the city, their source of water as well as access

"Feud possible motive for arson attack
Source:New Straits Times
PETALING JAYA: A family feud is one possible motive police are looking
into as they probe Friday's fire which killed a family of five.
They have begun recording statements from immediate family members,
relatives and neighbours into the case which has been classified as arson.
A Selangor police officer said they are still trying to ascertain the
motive for the attack.
A partially burnt towel soaked in kerosene was found at the entrance to
the house by the forensic team on Friday.
Investigations later revealed that the towel belonged to one of the
victims, leading police to believe that a family feud could be the motive
for the attack.
Police have also learnt of the feud from residents in the
neighbourhood.
A neighbour, Ong Sew Eng, 45, who claimed she heard a firecracker sound
and a motorcycle speeding away moments before the fire started, was also
questioned by police.
Her house, which is adjacent to the victims' house was also razed.
Another resident, Loke Moon Hoong, who lives opposite the house, said
he was watching television when he heard people shouting.
""I looked outside and saw the entrance of the house on fire. I tried to
put the fire out with a pail of water.""
""There was then an explosion from the inside which knocked me off my
feet. There was nothing more I could do for the victims.""
It was Loke who alerted the Fire and Rescue Department.
The fire claimed the lives of Leong Sun, 62, his wife, Tan Lian Chee,
53, and their three children, Chiew Choon, 14, Chiew Foong, 12, and Shuet
Whey, eight.
Chiew Choon and Chiew Foong were found huddled together on the floor
while the rest were in sleeping positions on their beds.
The fire which razed their home at Jalan PJU 1/30 in Kampung Cempaka
here, was believed to have started about 3am.
There were five other relatives sleeping on the top floor of the
double-storey house. They escaped by jumping out of a window.
They were identified as Chow Wah and Chan Poh Yin, both 49, Chow Chee
Wai, 23, his girlfriend, Liew Ju Ann, 19, and six-year-old Chow Mun Piew.
They told police they banged on the victims' bedroom door but there was
no answer. They then decided to save themselves as the flames were
spreading quickly.
Leong was said to be a carpenter while his wife worked as a cleaner in
several homes. Their three children were schooling.
The caskets carrying the bodies of the victims have been placed in a
makeshift funeral parlour in the area. Relatives, friends and neighbours
paid their last respects.
The children's classmates were also there yesterday, some of them
sobbing.
Meanwhile, the Fire and Rescue Department's forensic team yesterday
took several items from the scene of the fire as investigations into the
possibility of arson continues.
Department director-general Datuk Hamzah Abu Bakar said the
investigations were focused on finding out the cause of the fire, and the
allegation that fire engines had arrived late at the scene.
Hamzah said every call received by the department was logged and
recorded by the central information centre in Shah Alam.
Records showed that calls were made to the Damansara and Petaling Jaya
fire stations at 3.25am on Friday and that the fire engines reached the
scene at 3.34am.
""Reports in newspapers that the fire engines took 45 minutes to arrive
were incorrect.""
Housing and Local Government Minister Datuk Seri Ong Ka Ting, who was
at the scene yesterday, said he viewed the allegations seriously, and

office here in March, police investigations showed.
Police investigations and statements recorded from the Johor DOE staff

He also admitted that police could not establish the area in the

"'Arson behind fire at warehouse'
Source:New Straits Times
PUTRAJAYA, Wed. - The much-publicised fire at Asean Security Paper Mills
Sdn Bhd warehouse in Kampung Acheh in Sitiawan 17 years ago was due to
arson and not spontaneous combustion.
The man who planned the fire and its execution was then company
chairman, N. Balasingham, the Court of Appeal ruled today.
The three-member panel's decision goes beyond attaching blame for the
fire - it will save CGU Insurance Bhd RM32.4 million in claims by the
security paper company.
The Court of Appeal had established beyond a reasonable doubt that the
fire was intentionally set by two persons acting on Balasingham's
instructions, judges Datuk Gopal Sri Ram, Datuk Alauddin Mohd Sheriff and
Datuk Abdul Kadir said in a 107-page judgment.
They said the High Court judge had misdirected himself on the facts and
evidence of the case without judicial appreciation of the evidence of
relevant and material witnesses.
Consequently, there had been a substantial miscarriage of justice.
The judges contended that Balasingham had planned the fire and its
execution with the intention of causing ASPM to make a false and
fraudulent claim against CGU.
The judges said this case was, on its facts, one in which the
circumstantial evidence, taken as a whole, was so compelling that it had
led them to the conclusion that the claim was fraudulently made.
The fire on Sept 11, 1989, reduced the building and its contents to
ashes.
ASPM subsequently made a claim but CGU (now known as Aviva Insurance
Bhd) refused to pay. In its defence, CGU said the claim was fraudulent.
The judges said Balasingham was repeatedly mentioned by more than one
witness in relation to the part he played in the matter.
""The respondent's (ASPM) failure to call him as a witness although he
was present in court warrants the drawing of adverse inference,"" they
said.
Balasingham, also known as B. Nithiabala, still has an outstanding
criminal charge against him in the appeal stage at the Ipoh High Court.
He was acquitted by the Sessions Court on Nov 26, 1997, on a charge of
abetting A. Wilfred Silva and L. Mathews Selwaraja in committing mischief
by setting fire to the godown.
Then Sessions Court judge Choong Siew Khim acquitted him after calling

"Police probe into Chinatown arson completed swiftly
Source:New Straits Times
KUALA LUMPUR, Fri. - Chinatown hawkers whose livelihood was affected when
arsonists destroyed seven stalls for failing to pay exorbitant rentals
will resume business soon.
Touched by their plight, the police swiftly completed their on-the-scene
investigations to enable the hawkers to rebuild their stalls and resume
business.
Their legal advisor, Wee Choo Keong, said today the hawkers were
appreciative of Dang Wangi police chief, Assistant Commissioner Bakri
Zinin, who took into consideration their loss of earnings.
He said Bakri ensured a swift investigation into the incident which
occurred on Tuesday, as the police chief did not want to burden the
victims any further.
Wee, who is also Malaysian Democratic Party protem secretary-general,
hoped the police would complete investigations into the alleged activities
of Chinatown's gangland leader nicknamed, Ah Mun Chai, who was reportedly
responsible for the fire.
Last Tuesday, the hawkers were shocked when they found the stalls set
ablaze by arsonists.
It was understood the incident was sparked off when the hawkers failed
to settle exorbitant monthly rentals.
Initial investigations by the city Fire and Rescue Department revealed
that arsonists were responsible for the blaze.
Subsequently, the hawkers lodged police reports in connection with the
incident.
Meanwhile, Wee called on the Registrar of Societies to investigate the
activities and finances of Chinatown's Hawkers and Petty Traders
Association.
Checks by the New Straits Times revealed that Ah Mun Chai was allegedly
linked to Chinatown's gaming activities.

"Arson deaths: Probe spreads to Singapore
Source:New Straits Times
JOHOR BARU, Thurs. - The heat of an inquiry into the arson deaths of a
woman and her two teenage daughters in Taman Kempas here yesterday has
spread to Singapore.
Johor police said they were waiting for a statement from an already
married Singaporean Seah Chong Boon, 44, who is believed to be the father
of victims Liang Yee Ling, 16, and Ying Heng, 14.
The sisters, trapped with their mother Liang Poh Chan, 44, in an
upstairs bedroom in their one-and-a-half-storey home, perished in the
early morning fire.
Only Poh Chan's mother, 70-year-old Tan Mei, who was sleeping
downstairs, managed to escape unhurt through the back door.
Johor Baru (south) police chief Senior Assistant Commissioner II Hashim
Mohd Yusof said Seah's family was unaware of his other family in Malaysia.
All they knew was he had ""relatives"" in Johor Baru.
They found out when news of the fiery deaths was made known to Seah at
their home in Sembawang.
Seah, a logistics contractor, who also has a 20-year-old son and a 17-
year-old daughter, had apparently admitted that Poh Chan was his ""second
wife"" (a term often used among Chinese to mean mistress).
""We have sought assistance from our counterparts in Singapore to assist
us in the case and get a statement from him,"" said Hashim.
It is believed that Seah met Poh Chan 17 years ago when he was on
holiday in Malaysia.
He had since provided for his Malaysian family - a house, car and paying
for the girls' education - until the relationship became strained in April
this year.
Apparently, Seah said Poh Chan told him she wanted to leave him,
although she was not seeing anyone else.
She had apparently called the police to chase him away when he insisted
on seeing her.
Police are investigating eye-witness reports that a high-powered
motorcycle had stopped in front of the house shortly before the house
caught fire around 3am.
A man in his 20s then climbed over the gate of the house while the
pillion rider, a woman, waited outside. Both of them were wearing helmets.
The man was seen hurling a bottle containing kerosene at the house. An
explosion was heard seconds later.
Police have classified the case as murder under Section 302 of the Penal
Code.

"150 questioned on arson incident
Source:New Straits Times
KUALA LUMPUR, Wed. - Police have questioned 150 people in a series of
operations in Air Panas, 48 hours after a pre-dawn blaze claimed the lives
of a woman, her husband and their newborn baby.
A city police party from the Vice, Gambling and Secret Society Division
(D7) led by Chief Inspector M. Kumarasan interviewed the sole witness, A.
Letchumanan, who was discharged from the Kuala Lumpur Hospital around noon
today.
The interview was held at his daughter's house in Jalan Air Telaga,
Setapak, about 300 metres from the razed squatter site.
Despite showing him folder mugshots of 350 suspected secret society
elements, Letchumanan was unable to identify the arsonists.
Police are not leaving any stone unturned. All possible motives behind
the attack are being investigated and police have not ruled out revenge as
the reason for the attack.
They are also investigating if the attack was related to drug
distribution activities in the area.
It was learnt that about two weeks prior to the attack Letchumanan
chided a few men believed to be dadah pushers to take their business
elsewhere.
The men were said to have parked their car in front of his house and
were arguing about some dealings among themselves.
Letchumanan is the Air Panas MIC branch chairman and the Wangsa Maju
division deputy chairman. He also is the person whom the squatters
complain to whenever undesirable activities take place in the settlement.
L. Vimala, 36, who is the eldest daughter of Letchumanan, said reports
claiming Vivekanada was a part-time car repossessor was false.
""Please, we have gone through enough, we are not giving any more
statements, please do not speculate, just leave it to the police,"" she
said.
She also declined to allow the couple's twin daughters to be
photographed.
Vivekanada is the only son of five siblings. His youngest sister is
married to K. Suraskumar, 32, who is an authorised repossessor with
Maybank Finance Berhad, while his second sister is married to A.
Simasalam, 38, a security guard who owns the destroyed Proton Satria that
was parked in the porch of the burnt wooden house.
Two days ago, while Letchumanan was watching a football match on
television, he heard movements outside his home in Jalan Air Panas,
Setapak.
He first thought nothing of it until he caught the odour of petroleum.
Upon unlocking the front door, he saw three men dousing petrol from an
aluminium can on his squatter unit.
They also splashed petrol on him and threw a lit torch into the house.
The fire spread rapidly, and after saving his 54-year-old mother
Valliyamah, four-year-old twin daughters and his father, Vivekanada rushed
into the burning house in an attempt to rescue his wife.
During the blaze, the expectant mother  delivered a baby girl . All
three of them died in the blaze.
A disposable lighter and a torch were found at the scene.

"Court overturns arson conviction
Source:New Straits Times
KUALA LUMPUR, Fri. - Former assistant air traffic controller Johari Saaid,
convicted and sentenced to 10 years' jail for arson at the Sultan Abdul
Aziz Shah International Airport in 1992, should have been discharged at
the end of the prosecution's case, the High Court ruled today.
Setting aside the conviction and sentence, Judge Datuk Kang Hwee Gee
said the circumstantial evidence relied upon by the Sessions Court in
convicting Johari in 1996 could not have clearly pointed to the fact that
he had committed the arson.
""It is trite law that circumstantial evidence, in order to implicate an
accused, must point to no other conclusion other than the guilt of the
accused,"" he said.
Johari, 48, was convicted by the Sessions Court in Petaling Jaya onAug
2, 1996 after being found guilty of setting fire and destroying the flight
communication centre at Terminal One of the airport at 5.15am on Oct 15,
1992. He was charged on Oct 4, 1994.
He obtained a stay of execution pending appeal and was granted RM40,000
bail. His appeal began on March 28.
Johari, who was accompanied by his wife Salmah Hashim, 43, and children
in the court today, hugged and thanked his lawyer K.Y. Leong, who appeared
on behalf of lawyer K. Balaguru.
Johari, who now lives in his home town in Balik Pulau, Penang, later
told reporters he was thankful to God and was very happy.
In his judgment Kang said although the prosecution had succeeded in
proving that jet fuel or kerosene had been used in the arson and Johari
had bought kerosene on two occasions before the incident, the evidence was
not enough to implicate him.
""Merely proving that he had purchased the kerosene would not make it any
more likely that he would be using it to commit arson.
""Kerosene is a common household substance which can be bought by any
person for a variety of uses such as for cleaning, lighting, cooking,
etc.,"" he said.
He also said that the Sessions Judge's finding that Johari's motive in
burning the place down was to achieve his purpose of being transferred
back to Penang was too remote.
""Merely because he had wanted a transfer badly to Penang does not
necessarily provide a motive for him to burn his place of work. It is far
too remote.""
Kang said even if Johari did not have a place to stay in Subang (as
stated in the Sessions Judge's finding), it was not legitimate to come to
a finding that he had bought the kerosene only for burning that portion of
the airport.

places of worship when they nabbed four suspects in connection with the
arson attempts at two surau in Muar.
The four suspects, including a policeman's son, were nabbed a day after
they lodged a report claiming they put out the fire at one surau after
seeing two men fleeing on a motorcycle.
Police realised that the suspects were contradicting each other while
having their statements recorded and after further investigations,
arrested the four on Friday.
Police have now solved the acts of vandalism at the two surau in Muar,
the Metro Tabernacle Church in Desa Melawati and the All Saints, St Louis
churches and Sekolah Menengah Convent in Taiping,
To date, police have nabbed 19 suspects in connection with acts of

Deputy Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Ismail Omar said the suspects
arrested on Friday in Muar were three 17-year-olds and a 26-year-old man.
All of them work at a foodstall owned by one of the suspects' father not

""Initial investigations revealed they were emotionally-charged and had
acted mischievously, without realising the consequences.""
One of the 17-year-olds is the son of a lance corporal attached to the
police armoury.
""The father was not aware of his son's activity,"" Ismail said.
He warned all parties concerned not to do anything that could create

places of worship.
""When in doubt, check with us. Don't jump to conclusions,"" he added.
He also commended the police chiefs of Perak, Kuala Lumpur, and Johor
for their quick action in nabbing the culprits.
The suspects in Muar were yesterday remanded to facilitate
investigations for causing mischief by fire, a charge under Section 436 of
the Penal Code.
The arrests came less than 48 hours after the two surau in Jalan Ismail
Omar and Jalan Salleh, which were only less than 2km apart, were hit with
arson attempts.
According to a police official in Johor, the four suspects were
initially spotted by policemen on patrol duty at a stall in the area at
about 2am.
The policemen questioned the four on what they were doing out at that

"Director's arson case saga ends after 19 years
IPOH: For nearly 20 years, the criminal charge against B. Nithiabala, a
director of Asean Security Paper Mills Sdn Bhd, hung like the sword of
Damocles over his head.
But the 52-year-old, who was also a shareholder of the company,
maintained he was innocent.
In June 1990, he was charged in the Sessions Court with abetting to
destroy the company's warehouse at the Kampung Acheh industrial area in
Sitiawan, by setting fire to it on Sept 11, 1989.
The fire resulted in the loss of all stocks of a variety of papers
stored in the warehouse.
Apart from the stocks, the warehouse and a forklift were also
destroyed.
Twelve years later, Nithiabala was acquitted by the Sessions Court in
April 2002 on the ground that he had raised a reasonable doubt in the
prosecution's case.
The prosecution, however, immediately filed an appeal in the High Court
against the acquittal.
Yesterday, the High Court upheld his acquittal and Judicial
Commissioner Ridwan Ibrahim ruled that he would not interfere with the
decision of the Sessions Court.
Ridwan said although he agreed that the Sessions Court had rightfully
decided to ask Nithiabala to enter his defence, he also agreed that the
defence had successfully raised a reasonable doubt at the end of the
prosecution's case.
""This court is thereby of the opinion that it will not interfere with
the decision of the Sessions Court.
""The finding of the lower court is based on facts and evidence
presented before it which are not available to this court.
""In such instance, this court has always acted cautiously in deciding
to intervene in matters that have been decided by the lower courts.
""Therefore, this court will not interfere with the decision of the
Sessions Court.
""I now dismiss the appeal (by the prosecution).""
Nithiabala, who was represented by counsel A. Mahendran, Haresh
Mahadevan and Ramzani Idris, appeared calm when Ridwan delivered his
decision.
He, however, declined to speak to reporters after the court adjourned.
Deputy public prosecutor Ahmad Shazeli Abdul Khairy appeared for the
appellant.
Asean Security Paper Mills was a joint-venture project approved by the
Asean economic ministers and included shareholders from Asean member
countries.

"Arson poser as fire destroys DOE files
Source:New Straits Times
JOHOR BARU, Thurs. - A mysterious fire at the Johor Department of
Environment headquarters here early this morning destroyed 70 per cent of
the department's files.
Among the papers consumed by the 2am fire were documents related to
investigations into the illegal storage and dumping of toxic waste in the
State.
The most prominent of these was the case of a company, Synenviro Sdn
Bhd, which illegally imported toxic waste from Taiwan last year.
The waste is now stored at Johor Port and a brick factory in Simpang
Renggam.
Another case was that of an illegal dump near Kampung Lunchu in Kota
Tinggi, where a waste disposal contractor disposed of toxic waste
collected from factories in 1999.
It is learnt that summaries of some of these cases had been sent to the
Attorney-General's Chambers for a decision on whether or not to prosecute.
There is now concern that without the investigation papers, which had
been stored in the gutted room, the authorities will have a difficult
time taking these and other cases to court.
Johor DOE director Dr Abdul Rahman Awang today lodged a police report
on the incident.
He said his officers would only enter the room to sift through the
files after the police and the Fire and Rescue Department had completed
their investigations.
""Right now, we do not know which files have been destroyed and which
remain intact,"" Rahman said.

"FDA CONFIRMS ORPHAN DRUG EXCLUSIVITY APPROVAL FOR WILATE(R), OCTAPHARMA USA'S NEW
FDA CONFIRMS ORPHAN DRUG EXCLUSIVITY...
ATTENTION EDITOR,GENERAL DESK
HOBOKEN, N.J., Aug. 2 /PRNewswire-AsiaNet/ --
Approval Provides Seven Years of FDA Marketing Exclusivity
Octapharma USA has received confirmation of orphan drug exclusivity from the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for wilate(R) (von Willebrand
Factor/Factor VIII Concentrate, Human), the replacement therapy developed
specifically for von Willebrand Disease (VWD). The approval comes from the FDA
Office of Orphan Products Development, which helps to advance the development of
products that demonstrate promise for the treatment of rare diseases.
""In awarding orphan drug exclusivity, the FDA Office determined that wilate(R)
offers greater viral safety than Humate-P,"" said Flemming Nielsen, President of
Octapharma USA, the rapidly growing U.S. division of Octapharma
AG, one of the world's largest human protein products manufacturers. ""wilate(R)
has received seven years of marketing exclusivity as a result of the evidence
suggesting wilate(R) is as efficacious and safer than Humate P.""
The FDA has approved wilate(R) for the treatment of spontaneous or
trauma-induced bleeding episodes in patients with severe VWD as well as in
patients with mild or moderate forms of the illness in whom the use of
desmopressin is known or suspected to be ineffective or contraindicated.
wilate(R) is the first double virus inactivated VWF/FVIII (von Willebrand Factor
/ Factor FVIII), high-purity concentrate, utilizing the solvent/detergent (S/D)
process and a special terminal dry-heating (TDH) step. The selected purification
processes isolates the VWF/FVIII complex under highly protein-protecting
conditions, resulting in a 1:1 ratio of VWF:RCo (ristocetin cofactor) to FVIII
activity that is similar to normal plasma. No albumin is added as a stabilizer.
wilate(R) is exclusively derived from large pools of human plasma collected in
U.S. FDA approved plasma donation centers. wilate(R) contains a VWF triplet
structure and VWF mulitmeric distribution similar to normal human plasma.
According to the National Institutes of Health, VWD is the most common inherited
bleeding disorder and occurs in about 1 out of every 100 to 1,000 people. ""The
FDA orphan drug exclusivity approval for wilate(R) confirms Octapharma's
decision to focus exclusively on the treatment of von Willebrand patients and
further demonstrates Octapharma's commitment to the continued advancement of
human protein therapies,"" said Nielsen.

"DRUG SMUGGLERS USE AIR COURIER SERVICES, IRANIAN AMONG DUO ARRESTED
POLICE-DRUGS
KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 2 (Bernama) -- International drug traffickers have turned
to air courier services to smuggle drugs into the country but this was detected
by the police who seized 113kg of syabu worth RM24.86 million from a house in
Sri Hartamas here on Saturday.
In the 3pm raid at semi-detached house, a local man aged 42 and an Iranian
man aged 26 were arrested by the Bukit Aman Narcotics Criminal Investigation
Department.
Bukit Aman CID deputy director Datuk Othman Harun said the police found the
drug in crystal form wrapped in plastics in eight cylinders and the consignment
was declared as ice packets when it arrived at KL International Airport (KLIA)
on July 30.
He said the operation was conducted with the cooperation of the Central
Narcotics Bureau of Singapore.
The police also seized RM260,000 and a Mercedez Benz E250, which was
recently purchased, from the Iranian, who rented the house for RM13,000 a month,
said Othman.
""The police believe the drug is meant for local and international markets.
""We are investigating the link between the local man and the Iranian and
from where the drug consignment originated. The remaining members of the
syndicate will be arrested,"" he said.
He said the duo, who had no previous records, were remanded for until
Saturday.
Othman said the police would also investigate whether a previous drug haul
at a house in Kepong on July 22 involving another Iranian man was related to the
Saturday's raid.
He said Iranian nationals arrested in previous raids were not only drug
mules but also members of drug trafficking syndicates.
""There is an upsurge in Iranian drug smugglers and mules arrested. We nabbed
108 Iranian drug traffickers and mules, including 20 women, so far this year
compared to only 20 for the whole of last year,"" said Othman.
He said 13kg of syabu was seized from Iranian syndicates last year and with
the latest seizure, the police had confiscated 270kg of syabu so far this year.
""In the past three months about 40 Iranian drug mules were nabbed. The
figure dropped in May but of late it is on the rise although it involved small
quantities of less than one kg compared to 2kg last year.
""We believe they were trying to cut down their loses,"" he added.
Othman said a task force was set up by Bukit Aman CID and the KLIA in the
fight against drug syndicates using mules and air cargo services.
He said the police also succeeded in suppressing the activities of Iranian
syndicate members renting houses to be used as drug laboratories.
""So far this year we raided three houses used as drug labs compared to two
last year. We seized drugs worth RM40 million from the raids,"" he said.

"DRUG PEDDLERS RESORTING TO BARTER TRADING WITH ADDICTS
TAWAU-THEFT
TAWAU, Nov 2 (Bernama) -- Drug peddlers are now resorting to barter trade in
their unholy transactions with addicts.
Initial police investigations have revealed that addicts who are short on
cash, exchange stolen car accessories, cell phones and electrical goods for
their 'fix'.
The police uncovered this new 'barter trading' between drug peddler and
addict during a raid at a house in Jalan Kuhara near here in August.
In that raid at the home of a drug peddler, Tawau police chief Assistant
Commissioner Ibrahim Chin said the police detained a dadah addict mother of
three.
He said, from the 29-year-old woman's house, the police seized an assortment
of stolen items including a handycam, digital camera, 20 cell phones, 12 car
radios and two mini hi-fi radios, among others.
In a follow-up operation on Oct 18, Ibrahim said the woman's 33-year-old
husband was nabbed in Kota Kinabalu to facilitate investigations into a series
of barter trading transactions with drug addicts.
He appealed to victims of car break-ins to go to the Tawau police station to
identify the stolen items to prefer charges against the man.

As such, it was suggested that the AADK intensified enforcement and

"'UNHOLY MARRIAGE': MALAYSIA-BASED TRIAD GANG, INDIAN UNDERWORLD IN DRUG TRADE
DRUGS-TRIAD
CHENNAI, Sept 4 (Bernama) -- A Malaysia-based triad society is suspected to
have linked up with the Indian underworld to capture a slice of the flourishing
drug trafficking trade in the region.
This startling exposure comes in the wake of the arrest of a Malaysian man
by
Indian police, when he attempted to smuggle out 300kg of ephedrine via Chennai
Port to Malaysia, by faking the contents of the cargo.
The 34-year-old suspect, with a Kuala Lumpur address and unknown occupation,
was picked up by Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) sleuths enroute to boarding a
flight to Malaysia from Chennai last Friday night, after completing his
clandestine operation.
""We found he is a regular visitor to Chennai and was connected to a triad
gang
in Kuala Lumpur.
""He must have been working for a bigger network...we have also arrested two
Indian nationals in connection with the case,"" NCB South Zonal director S.
Davidson Devasirvathan told Bernama today.
Interrogators believe the suspect had procured all consignments locally with
the help of Indian-based drug dealers in Chennai -- which is often used as a
convenient gateway by drug traffickers.
""The suspect had come to Chennai to make a booking of the substance, which
is
easily available in India, through an agent.
""The 'master' (suspect's triad gang boss) is in Malaysia,"" said Davidson,
adding that the ephedrine, filled in 12 drums and discovered at Chennai Port,
was estimated at nearly RM1.5 million in the black market.
Ephedrine, a stimulant substance widely used in Chinese traditional
medicine,
can also be converted to methamphetamine which is commonly used as 'party
drug' and in great demand in Southeast Asian cities among party-goers.
Davidson said NCB, India's elite drug enforcement agency, would get in touch
with its Malaysian counterparts soon to unearth more information on the
Malaysian suspect and the Kuala Lumpur-based triad gang.
The suspects are now being held under judicial custody as investigations
are still in progress.
Two months ago, the Directorate of Revenue (DRI), another investigating
agency, arrested four Indians in Chennai, linked to an international racket
involved in trafficking ephedrine.
The ephedrine was smuggled to China, Malaysia and the Philippines.
In India, ephedrine is a controlled substance under the Narcotic Drugs and
Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 and special licence is needed for its export.

fact and that the Court of Appeal also did not make any error in upholding the
conviction and death sentence on Nobies.
Nobies, 41, was convicted by the Shah Alam High Court of trafficking in two
packages of heroin weighing 412.8g at the premises of United Parcel Service
(UPS) at No. 11, Jalan Tandang, Petaling Jaya about 12.20pm on March 9, 1996.
The Court of Appeal on July 30, last year upheld the conviction and
sentence.
Lawyer Karpal Singh, representing Nobies, submitted that there was no
positive identification because Nobies was identified by the two UPS staff at
the trial which commenced in 2003, seven years after the incident.
He said it was a serious misdirection by the high court to convict Nobies.
Deputy Public Prosecutor Nurul Huda Noraini Mohamed Noor argued that Nobies
had possession of the package because he handed it to the UPS to be couriered.
She said both prosecution witnesses could positively identify Nobies in
the dock as the person who had come to the UPS to have the package couriered.

POLICE-SEIZE
KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 5 (Bernama) -- The Narcotics Crime Investigation Department
has seized properties worth RM34.9 million belonging to drug syndicate members
in the country during the first half of this year.
They include movable assets such as cash worth RM3.92 million, money kept in
banks worth RM5.62 million and motorised vehicles worth RM13.2 million, and
immovable assets such as houses and premises worth RM9.197 million and land
worth RM179,200.
Bukit Aman Narcotics Crime Investigation Department deputy director (operation)
Datuk Othman Harun told Bernama, police also seized RM1.98 million in shares
owned by syndicate members either locals or foreigners who plied their trade in
the country.
These assets also included jewellery and electronic devices such as mobile
phones and cameras, he said.
The amount, however, was much lower than the RM37.2 million worth of assets and
properties seized during the same period last year, he said.
""Last year, we managed to uncover illegal drug processing centres and because
of that, syndicates are now shifting their operations to the neighbouring
countries,"" he said.
He said that from 2007 to June this year, police also seized RM177.1 million in
properties and assets believed to be proceeds from drug transactions.
""The court will ascertain whether these assets were obtained illegally or not.
""If they were obtain legally, the syndicates would have the right to claim them
through their lawyer. Otherwise, these assets would be handed over to the
government,"" he said.
Othman also revealed that regional syndicates had once used locations in
Malaysia as the processing centres for a huge amount of drug.
Police, however, managed to cripple the operations of these laboratories,
resulting in huge losses to drug syndicates, he said.
He added that the laboratories, found in Johor, Kedah and Selangor, could
produce between 300kg and 500kg of drugs.
Othman also said that the high demand for drugs in the country had also
resulted in foreigners attempting to enter the ""market"" by bringing in drugs for
local consumption.
Foreign syndicates had also been using the country as the transit point
en-route to the neighbouring countries to market their drugs there, he said.
""One of the most common ways of transporting drugs was through flights where
syndicate members would board flights bound for destinations in this region,
such as Thailand, before transporting the drugs by road.
""But the amount was not high compared to those processed locally,"" he said.

"VAPOUR TRACER: NAMESIS OF THE DRUG SMUGGLER
DRUGS-DETECT
PUTRAJAYA, June 15 (Bernama) -- The potential drug smuggler is set to meet his
namesis soon.
Called the 'Vapour Tracer', it takes just eight seconds for the RM200,000
device to detect drugs on a suspect, without disturbing other flight passengers.
To effectively curb drug smuggling, the customs department will soon use the
'Vapour Tracer', to detect even the faintest trace of narcotics in the body or
goods carried by a suspect.
Its narcotics division deputy director, Subri Awang, said the device was more
practical as it was mobile and could replace the role of narcotics detecting
dogs during operations.
""The device has been proven effective and 3,000 units are currently used in
several countries such as Hong Kong, Australia and the United States.
""We will be the first agency in the country to utilise the device. We believe
it will facilitate our efforts to eradicate the increasingly rampant drug
smuggling activities in the country,"" he told reporters after the devices were
handed over to the customs department by their distributor, Hadid Engineering
(M) Sdn Bhd, in a ceremony here today.
Subri said the 'Vapour Tracer' could also trace objects within eight
seconds, without disturbing flight passengers.
Beginning today, he said one unit would be tested for its effectiveness at
the KL International Airport (KLIA).
Besides KLIA, he said the Vapour Tracer would also be stationed at the Low
Cost Carrier Terminal and Port Klang.
""The authorities will use the device to inspect areas touched by the public,
such as car steering wheel or ticket stubs, without disrupting other

separate raids in the city and Selangor this week.
Kuala Lumpur police chief Datuk Wira Muhammad Sabtu Osman said during the
first raid, police detained two men aged 41 and 55 and seized 38 slaps of ganja
weighing 33.7kg and worth RM85,000.
Muhammad Sabtu told reporters at the Kuala Lumpur police headquarters that
police had initially detained the 41-year-old man who was walking with a bag in
Kampung Baru at 7.40pm on Wednesday and found 5.6kg of ganja in his bag.
He added that the suspect later led police to his car (Volvo) that was
parked at the Seri Nilam Condominium in Bandar Baru Ampang where police found 29
slaps of ganja weighing 27.2kg.
""Upon inspecting his house, another 0.9kg of ganja was found,"" he said.
Three hours later, police detained his 55-year-old accomplice, a taxi
driver, believed to be involved in drug trafficking, in Taman Seri Gombak, Batu

Muhammad Sabtu said both suspects who had previous criminal records also
tested positive for drugs.

"COURT TO DECIDE WHETHER LORRY DRIVER WILL BE CALLED TO DEFEND DRUG TRAFFICKING
COURT-SYABU
KUANTAN, Sept 15 (Bernama) -- The High Court here today set Sept 29, to
decide whether a lorry driver, accused of trafficking 753,359 grams of
methamphetamine (syabu) worth more than RM200 million on May 2, last year, will
be called to defend the charges.
High Court judicial commissioner Datuk Akhtar Tahir fixed the date after
hearing submissions from the prosecution and defence.
Earlier, Datuk V. Sithambaram, counsel for the accused, Lee Yong Toe,
48, had questioned the credibility and integrity of a number of policemen who
were the witnesses in the case, had admitted to taking four packets of syabu
during the raid as a ""reward for their hard work"".
Meanwhile, another defence lawyer Hisham Teh Poh Teik said the prosecution
had failed to call two important witnesses who were also detained, to testify in
court.
He said the duo, including the brother of Lee who was detained under the
Dangerous Drugs Act, could provide further clarification on the case which is
the biggest Syabu bust in the country.
Deputy Public Prosecutor Jamil Aripin said the packets of syabu taken by the
policemen would not interfere or affect the quality and identity of the drugs
seized.
""The credibility of the witness is the prerogative of the court to decide
but that does not mean all their statements need to be rejected,"" he said.
As to why the two were not called to testify in court, Jamil said their
testimony would not assist the prosecution because they were detained at a
different place and time.
He added that the court must take into account the factor that the accused
had knowledge of the drugs because he was the registered owner of the lorry and
responsible for the goods he was carrying.
The action by the accused to use a type of spray on the police when trying
to escape, showed that he knew he was carrying illegal goods in his lorry, he
said.
""There is no possibility that someone will try to place drugs worth hundreds
of millions of ringgit in the lorry,"" he said.
Lee, 48, is charged with trafficking in 753,359g of methamphetamine worth
more than RM200mil with another man, who is still at large, in Jalan
Chenderawasih at 6.45am on May 2 last year.
Lee, from Taman Iskandar, Johor Baru, faces the death penalty if convicted.

"EX-STUDENT'S CONVICTION AND SENTENCE FOR DRUG POSSESSION UPHELD
COURT-DRUG
PUTRAJAYA, March 16 (Bernama) -- The Federal Court here today upheld the
conviction and 18 years jail and 12 strokes of the rotan imposed on a former
student for possessing 22.88gm of heroin.
Justice Datuk Wira Mohd Ghazali Mohd Yusoff, who sat with justices Datuk
Seri James Foong Cheng Yuen and Datuk Heliliah Mohd Yusof, made the order after
dismissing Mahasin Yasir Mahamad Yusoff's appeal.
Ghazali said it was a ""myth"" to offer a discount for cases involving drugs
as most offenders would be involved in other crimes such as snatch theft.
Heliliah said the Federal Court could not arbitrarily reduce the sentence
because it would be seen as denying the punishment imposed by the High Court and
Court of Appeal.
She said any reduction in sentence must be based on legal principles.
Mahasin Yasir, 31, then a student at a government-run skills centre for
youths, was initially charged with trafficking in the drug at the Rantau Panjang
Customs Complex in Pasir Mas, Kelantan, at 3.10pm on Aug 16, 2002.
However, at the end of the prosecution's case, the Kota Baharu High Court in
2004 reduced the charge to one of possession, to which Mahasin claimed trial.
He was found guilty of possession at the end of the defence case and
sentenced to 18 years jail and 12 strokes of the rotan.
His appeal for reduction of punishment was refused by the Court of Appeal.
Today, Mahasin Yasir's counsel, Mohd Fozi Zain, abandoned the appeal on
conviction but asked the the court to reduce the jail term on grounds that the
drug found was of a small quantity.
However, deputy public prosecutor Manoj Kurup said that Mahasin Yasir was
given a second chance because the prosecution did not appeal against the High
Court's decision to reduce the charge.

"NUMBER OF DRUG MULES DOWN
DRUG MULE
KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 17 (Bernama) -- While the number of drug mules from
Malaysia arrested in foreign countries has declined in the first six months of
2010, the problem is still a cause of concern.
This is because local and international drug syndicates are still recruiting
drug mules, albeit in smaller numbers, and sadly naive local youths are the easy
prey.
Up to present, a total of 1,490 Malaysians are languishing in foreign
prisons for drug related offences including drug mules.
Statistics from Bukit Aman indicate that between January and June this year
38 Malaysians were detained in foreign lands for carrying drugs and out of the
total 29 were male and nine female.
This is a steep decline when compared with the figure for the whole of last
year totaling 119 persons - 89 men and 30 women.
STUDENTS AND YOUTHS THE TARGET
The total detained for 2009 is a further reduction from 2008 that recorded
150 Malaysians arrested in foreign countries for carrying drugs with 98 of them
being men and the rest women.
The International Narcotic Control Board (INCB) pointed out that the current
trend is that the syndicates are targeting on Southeast Asia and East Asia in
their drug mule recruitment drive.
Their victims are normally between the 20s and 30s age range, free from
criminal records and unemployed or employed in clerical, sales or service
sectors.
The recruiters are often African nationals, who sweet talk the victims with
promises of lucrative paying foreign assignments. Many of the victims are lured
by gifts and exciting vacations. The cyberspace is often the mode used by the
syndicates to approach their victims.
The victims are often students or youths, often ignorant, lacking in
education, from broken or poor families, who are easily manipulated by drug
syndicates.
Christina Anak Luke Niju, 22, from Sandakan, Sabah, is a good example how
easy the students fall prey to the syndicates operating in the cyber realm.
The business studies student at a polytechnic in Kuching, Sarawak is now
being detained in China for carrying drugs.
She innocently followed her boyfriend that she met through a socialising
website to China and was arrested by the authorities.
Meanwhile Nur Dhiya Ain Rosman known affectionately as Baby who went to
South Africa to take up a tour guide job, realised too late that she was
actually being made use as a drug mule.
Baby who was recruited by an African is now incarcerated in Ravensmead in
Cape Town, South Africa for carrying a bag containing 1.2 kgs of Syabu.
COMPLAINS BUREAU
According to Umno Community Complains Bureau Chairman Datuk Muhd Khairun
Aseh, the fate that befell Baby is not an isolated one.
The bureau helps the innocent victims and not those who voluntarily chose to
be a drug mule.
He related to Bernama that women are most vulnerable to the temptations of
the syndicates. Other than being showered with love, they are also promised the
luxuries and jobs that they have been dreaming of.
""The vast reach of the social websites provides an easy avenue for the
syndicates to make contacts with their victims,"" he said.
DISABLED ALSO PREYED UPON
""The international drug syndicates are resorting to numerous tactics to lure
their victims that include the disabled and the mentally challenged,"" he said
illustrating a case handled by the bureau involving a disabled and mentally
challenged man.
P.Jayakumar, 37, is disabled and has received treatment 19 times for his
mental condition at Hospital Bahagia in Tanjung Rambutan for the last 10 years
but even in such physical and mental state the drug syndicates found him a good
choice to serve as a drug courier.
His first assignment was to collect a table side lamp in Brazil.
""He left with a ticket only with the travel documents arranged by the
syndicates, but while in transit at Buenos Aires, the Argentinian authorities
nabbed him on the suspicion he is a drug mule,"" he said.
With the assistance from Interpol, Jayakumar was located in Argentina, and
the bureau set out to help him after learning he is a victim of the syndicates.
""We helped him by proving that he has mental problems through the treatment
records and secured Jayakumar's release and he returned to his family last
April,"" he said.
VULNERABLE WOMAN
The bureau also handled a case where a woman living under poverty and on
welfare assistance was duped into becoming a drug mule.
The women fell victim to an African national who convinced her that there is
more money to be made if she sourced the material for her sewing business from
overseas.
She was taken in by the lucrative proposal and set out to Milan, Italy, to
procure fabrics with a friend with the passports and the travel documents
arranged by the syndicate.
""They failed to realise that they were carrying bags containing drugs and
were arrested upon arrival.
""They were initially given a 20-year sentence, but after appealing it was
reduced to six years and the bureau is now working to further reduce the
sentence,"" he said.
In another case, the bureau helped a Malaysian women detained in Pakistan
for the same offence two years ago.
This is a more convincing approach used by the syndicate - the scratch and
win gimmick that coincidently the victim took part.
The victim in her 40s was contacted by the syndicate that she had won a
three day two night holiday package to Singapore.
Before the holiday was over, the victim was contacted again and told that
there is a big bonus for her in the form of another holiday in Karachi,
Pakistan.
""Without thinking further the victim accepted the holiday offer and set off
to Karachi but was detained upon arrival when drugs were discovered in the bags
that she was carrying,"" he said.
She was given a two-year jail sentence but following an appeal she was
released and returned to her home in Perlis.
GREATER VIGILANCE NEEDED
Khairun noted that to eradicate the drug mule menace, the airport
check-in.
He proposed that the passengers declare in a form the baggage that they are
carrying and checking in.
""I find that at present no serious attention is given during the baggage

"MAN ESCAPES WHIPPING FOR DRUG CHARGE BECAUSE HE FACES DEATH FOR ANOTHER

PUTRAJAYA, Nov 18 (Bernama) -- A bus driver, convicted for drug possession,
escaped the mandatory whipping sentence because he is facing the death sentence
for another drug case.
Datuk Suriyadi Halim Omar leading a three-man Court of Appeal panel, made

"LIFE SHATTERED DUE TO DRUG ABUSE
DRUGS-ARTISTES
The first of a two-part series
KUALA LUMPUR, April 19 (Bernama) -- He used to be so popular sometime back.
His photos were prominently displayed in the entertainment magazines as well as
newspapers and his songs received regular radio play.
Apart from the regular television appearances, he is also adored by his
legion of fans.
However life in the fast lane had 'drowned' him and he began to take drugs
in his effort to remain energetic to face pressures in the entertainment world.
That proved to be his costly mistake as the nightmare began.
FACTORS INVOLVED
This is a true story about a popular artiste and performer who had gone
down the wrong path.
""The possibility of being drawn into the clutches of drug abuse is high
particularly in the life of artistes if they adopt an unhealthy lifestyle. If
they regularly patronise entertainment spots like night clubs and attend wild
parties, then one day this menace will caught up with them.
""It is also caused by the lifestyle and culture practised by the western
society that use drugs to control the pressures that they face,"" National Anti
Drugs Agency (AADK) Director-General Datuk Abdul Bakir Zin told Bernama in an
interview here recently.
The other factor is the lack of religious knowledge in an individual and
without the spiritual and religious strength within a person, he would resort to
taking drugs upon the slightest pressure and problem that he faces.
""They take drugs as the easiest way to run away from problems,"" he said.
He said the other factors are lack of positive attitude as well as the lack
of parenting skills by parents in a family.
""It is man's natural characteristic to be easily influenced. As a defence to
this, the individual should have a strong religious background. As when the
strong religious and spiritual defence is missing, then the person is prone to
negative influences,"" said Abdul Bakir.
ARTISTES AS ADDICTS AND TRAFFICKERS
Abdul Bakir said drug abuse has long existed among artistes. Lately, the
issue came under close scrutiny by the media as the artistes involved are
popular.
""In May 1997, a vocalist from a blues band was detained in Melaka and sent
to a rehabilitation centre (Puspen) until May 1999 followed by the detention of
a performer in a tv reality programme and this artiste was later placed under
the supervision of Sepang AADK for taking cannabis.
""The latest case involved a vocalist of a pop group popular in the 1990s who
turned himself in at the Seremban AADK for our rehabilitation programme,"" he
said.
Lately artistes have become more daring when they even started to traffick
drugs.
Abdul Bakir said a major factor to cause this problem is when a person
becomes an addict, and has to become a trafficker in order to meet his drug
addiction needs.
""There are people who take drugs but do not become traffickers and there
are those who traffick drugs but do not become addicts. Those who take drugs
are addicts while those who traffic drugs are out for easy money,"" he said.
He said the money factor had turned the traffickers to disregard the lives
and problems of others.
As for addicts who also turned into traffickers, they did that in order to
sustain their daily drug needs.
""They need money to get the drugs. The same with artistes...if they are
popular and rich then there are no problems in getting the drugs. But what about
the not so popular artistes who do not receive regular singing or acting offers.
Then it is a problem to them,"" he said.
POPULAR DRUGS
Abdul Bakir said the abuse of drugs changes according to the current trend
and lifestyle.
""Ten years ago, traditional drugs like opium and cannabis were popular with
addicts but now that drugs have faded away.  These drugs are now more popular
with addicts in the rural areas as they are much cheaper,"" he said.
He said addicts in the modern society have switched to the synthetic drugs.
""Synthetic drugs such as syabu and ecstasy are much more dangerous than the
traditional ones and addicts need a treatment process that differs from that
used for addicts who are on traditional drugs"".
He said synthetic drugs had prompted the existence of laboratories
processing these drugs.
""Synthetic drugs are more popular among artistes as these drugs have more
'potent' effects as compared to the traditional drugs like marijuana,"" he said.
DRUGS FREE IN 2015
According to Abdul Bakir, apart from the treatment rehabilitation programmes
held at 'Pusat Serenti' (rehabilitation centres), AADK also carried out the
integrated enforcement operation with other agencies.
The operation, named '1 Operation, 1 District, 1 Week' has been carried out
since November 2009.
""This integrated operation involves almost all of the enforcement agencies
such as Rela (Ikatan Relawan Rakyat volunteer corps), Civil Defence Department
and the local authorities.
He said the operation is able to weed out individuals involved in drug
abuse, including artistes.
""AADK carries out the operation once a week nationwide. However if there are
reports from the public on drug taking and peddling, we will conduct the raids,""
he said.
Abdul Bakir said AADK has strengthened its machinery in curbing the demand
and supply of drugs in the country via various aspects such as prevention,
treatment and rehabilitation including cooperation at the international level.
""This strategy is in line with AADK's mission as the main agency in
combating the drug menace in Malaysia. It is hoped that this effort will achieve
the people's vision of making Malaysia drugs free by 2015,"" he added.

DRUG-CLINICS
PUTRAJAYA, Dec 19 (Bernama) -- The 1Malaysia Cure And Care (C&C) clinics are
here to stay.
Since its inception on July 1, the clinics which have become the treatment
and reference hub for drug addiction, have accomodated 1,162 drug addicts at
five Narcotics Addiction Rehabilitation Centres (Puspen) nationwide.
While the number might be viewed as significantly small as compared to the
15,736 drug addicts recorded by the agency last year, National Anti-Drug Agency
director-general Datuk Zuraidah Mohamed translated it as a reflection of public
acceptance of the clinics.
She said the clinic's voluntary approach could be a main factor for the
acceptance by drug addicts and their families, relatives and employers.
""Puspen, which was first established in Sungai Besi, has a concept of open
narcotics addiction rehabilitation, which also serves as a treatment hub and
reference centre, to meet the needs of drug addicts.
""Since its inception on July 1, the response has been very encouraging and
the feedback, very positive, and we are less deluged with complaints,"" she told
Bernama here today.
Other centres (Puspen) which provide the service of the C&C clinic are
located in Bukit Mertajam, Penang for the northern zone, Kemunin in Kelantan
(eastern zone), Tampoi in Johor (south zone), Papar in Sabah and Kuching in
Sarawak.
Drug addicts and their families can come to the C&C clinics any time,
without having to go through legal procedures for treatment and advice from
specialist doctors and psychiatrists stationed at the clinics.
Zuraidah said those who came to the clinics would have to undergo
comprehensive examination by the doctor appointed to identify their treatment
needs.
""After the examination, the placement for the addicts would be provided in
four stages, beginning with residential or inpatient treatment and
rehabilitation, outpatient, daily and regular basis, and through support
services.
""This way, we will better understand the addicts and their needs...instead
of being forced to seek treatment at the clinic, they will come voluntarily to
recover from addiction,"" she said.
Apart from that, she said the agency had also set up a Triage Puspen, a
Hardcore Puspen and 1Puspen, as part of efforts to improve the existing
rehabilitation service and treatment.
The Triage Puspen at Kampung Selamat in Batu Kurau, Perak, was set up to
conduct screening, evaluation and categorisation of the addicts before they were
placed at the suitable Puspen.
""The categorisation period in the Triage Puspen will not take more than
three weeks, based on the stipulated criteria,"" she said.
The 1Puspen, established in Karangan Puspen in Kulim, Kedah, on the other
hand, was set up to receive addicts who had been assessed by the Triage Puspen
and it was meant for those who were highly motivated and had the potential to

when he tested positive for drugs.
The 27-year old teacher from Sekolah Kebangsaan Trolak was nabbed for alleged
possession of ecstasy pills.
The duo were among 44 people picked up at an entertainment outlet located at a
housing area in Bandar Behrang 2020 at 4.45am. Fourteen of the suspects were

"'PAIN AND SORROW', A HEAVY PRICE TO PAY FROM DRUG ABUSE
DRUGS-SORROW
The second article of a two-part feature
KUALA LUMPUR, April 20 (Bernama) -- ""That thing' killed my brother and
turned two others into zombies"".
That were the words of a 27-year-old woman who wished to be known as Adeeba.
The youngest of eight siblings was relating how drug abuse had created havoc in
her family and brought her much pain and sorrow.
The episode began when Adeeba, who hails from an east coast state, lost her
father at the age of six. This forced her mother to be the family's sole
breadwinner by selling food.
""I have four brothers. After my father died, my eldest brother took over the
responsibility of looking after his siblings when mother was out working.
""Being taken care by my eldest brother made me close to him. As our age gap
was close to 30 years, this also made me look up to him as my own father,"" she
said.
ABSENCE OF FAMILY HEAD
According to Adeeba, the absence of a father or family head had caused the
siblings to lose direction.
""We lived in hardship. My mother had to work hard and had to go everywhere
where she only returned home at night.
""Us siblings had no guidance. Each with her or his own affairs. Maybe from
the pressures and influence by village mates, my brothers began to flirt
with drugs after completing school,"" he said.
Three of her brothers began to work and the wages that they earned, they
used to buy the illicit drugs.
""They got their supply from the villagers who turned drug peddlers...hence
the supply of drugs was constant. Despite the authorities raided their dens a
number of times, they switched to other places and refused to kick the habit.
""They (addicts and peddlers) continue to take and sell drugs. As for my
brothers...if they didn't do it outside of the house, they would do it inside.
Advice from my mother and his siblings had fallen on deaf ears and we are forced
to accept that they had turned into drug addicts,"" she said.
MONEY FOR DRUGS
In order to support her brother's addiction, Adeeba's mother began to sell
off her valuables.
""My brothers performed petty work hence the wages they received were not
much. My mother's jewellery was sold off to satisfy their craving for
drugs...when there were no more valuables to sell, my brothers started to
dispose off things in the house in order to get the money to buy drugs"".
Instead of sending the brothers for rehabilitation, the family took pity on
them and began to provide the three brothers with the money needed to buy drugs.
""We cannot stand watching when their craving started...it was horrible and
they appeared to be very ill. As we felt sorry, we gave them whatever amount
that we had in order to ease some of their pain.
""Despite the repeated advice given by my mother, it was to no avail,"" said
Adeeba.
DEMISE OF ELDEST BROTHER
Adeeba said the situation remained unchanged even though her brother got
married.
""We thought he would change after getting married but it was no different.
Not even a year, he got divorced and he went to live and work in Johor.
""After he stayed in Johor, his condition was not as bad as what he had been
in the village. Despite rarely returning home, he sent us money regularly and
that made us to think that he had kicked away his addiction,"" said Adeeba.
They were wrong as Adeeba's eldest brother succumbed to illness and died
four years ago.
""Despite being addicts, my brothers were good. They respected the elderly
and adored the family. I felt lost when my eldest brother died. This is the
price he had to pay for being a drug addict,"" she said.
A HEAVY PRICE TO PAY
""Another two of my brothers are beyond help and are only waiting for their
time to go. They have been in and out of the rehabilitation centres for so many
times but nothing changed.
""Their health is deteriorating, whatever medicines given are not having any
effect,"" said Adeeba.
She said various attempts were used to help her two brothers but both were
not able to show any positive signs towards the treatment given.
""Now they are beyond help...no effect from any treatment applied. What we
can do is to pray for God to lessen their sufferings.
""It is heart-wrenching to witness their sufferings. It is a heavy price to
pay for abusing drugs. It not only brought havoc to the addicts but the whole
family as well,"" said Adeeba.

"EMBASSY: SUSPECTED DRUG SMUGGLER NOT IRANIAN POLICE OFFICER
IRAN-POLICE
KUALA LUMPUR, April 21 (Bernama) -- The Iranian Embassy has denied newspaper
reports that one of its three citizens detained here last Saturday by the police
for allegedly attempting to smuggle drugs worth RM1 million, was a policeman.
According to the embassy, checks with the Islamic Republic of Iran's
anti-narcotics police chief on the status of the 36-year-old suspect revealed he
was not a member of the Iranian police force.
At a press conference on April 17, the local police had stated that one of the
three suspects was an Iranian police officer.
In a statement to Bernama today, the embassy said it was incorrect to say that
the Iranian was a police officer.
On the other hand, it said, the Iranian police force had been a victim of a
mafia gang of drug smugglers, and (as a result) had not only suffered financial
and material losses, but also gave their lives to stop such activities.
On April 17, the suspect was detained with two other compatriots at the KL
International Airport at 8.45am.
Reports quoting the police said that the three suspects were behaving
suspiciously during inspection on passengers and their baggage.
The inspection showed that the metal handle of each of the five bags brought
by the suspects contained 0.8kg of syabu, Selangor CID (narcotics) deputy head
Supt Abdul Razak Md Zin had the press conference at the Sepang police
headquarters.
He said the trio were investigated under Section 39B of the Dangerous Drugs

RIOT-MULES
KUCHING, Oct 22 (Bernama) -- About half the Malaysians detained overseas
over
the past two decades were drug-related offenders, mostly deployed as 'mules'
to smuggle drugs for foreign syndicates.
They accounted for 50.4 per cent of the 1,560 locals who were nabbed between
1991 and this month,
Of the percentage, 33 currently faced the death penalty, Deputy Foreign
Minister Datuk Richard Riot said today.
Describing drug-trafficking as a very serious issue among Malaysians, he
said
785 cases were reported during that period.
Riot said that human trafficking, on the other hand, made up 3.2 per cent or
50
cases while those convicted of murder accounted for 1.72 per cent or 27 cases.
On those who were tricked into becoming 'drug mules', he expressed sadness
over their arrest and imposition of the death sentence as they might have been
ignorant of their actions.
The deputy minister was speaking to reporters after officiating the Foreign
Affairs Ministry's Outreach, Information and Public Diplomacy Programme.
On the detention of Sarawakian student Christina Luke Niju in Guangzhou,
China for allegedly carrying 1.4kg in drugs at the Meilan Airport on June 29, he
cautioned women in general not to fall prey to sweet-talking strangers.
Riot related that Christina, 22, had befriended an African man online before
she ended up carrying the drugs and became a victim of a human-trafficking
syndicate, as well.
He said under the Vienna Convention, Malaysia respected the law of another
country but Malaysian victims or their families could seek help from Wisma

"DRUG PROCESSING LAB UNCOVERED AFTER A FIRE
DRUGS - FIRE
GEORGE TOWN, Nov 23 (Bernama) -- Police have uncovered a drug processing
laboratory producing syabu estimated to be worth millions of ringgit when a
terrace house caught fire at Jalan Mata Kuching in Air Itam, here today.
A police spokesman said the drug processing syndicate was only uncovered
after the team from the Paya Terubong Fire and Rescue Station put out the fire
in the kitchen section of the house.
The spokesman said that during the fire at 10.15am, a team of firemen who
were putting out the fire came across various types of processed and unprocessed
drugs as well as various drug processing equipment.
""The Fire Department subsequently contacted the police, and upon inspecting
the house, police came across various coloured liquids which were believed to be
chemicals used to process drugs,"" the spokesman told reporters here.
Police also seized a four-wheel-drive Pajero for investigation to identify
its owner, and it was believed that members of the syndicate had fled because
they knew that their activities had been uncovered.
Initial investigation showed that members of the syndicate had been arguing
among themselves before the fire broke out.

a black man, but Badriah noted that she had failed to give further information
on that person when cross-examined.
Badariah said that Nenggani had knowledge and exclusive possession of the
drugs hidden in the clothes that she was wearing for several hours before she
was arrested.
""I find that the defence have failed to raise reasonable doubt while the
prosecution have proved beyond a reasoable doubt their case. I, therefore, find

"POLICE TO STATION OFFICERS IN SIX DRUG PRODUCING COUNTRIES
POLICE-NARCOTICS
KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 25 (Bernama) -- Malaysian police are expected to station
at least one officer from the narcotics division in six countries identified as
leading drug producers in the world.
Bukit Aman Narcotics Department director Datuk Zulhasnan Najib Baharuddin
said the officers would be housed at the Malaysian Embassy offices in the
respective countries.
Zulhasnan who did not name the countries said if every process went as
planned, the initiative would be implemented by mid-year.
""By placing officers in the respective countries, we can acquire information
and exchange expertise with the enforcement agencies of the respective countries
in efforts to prevent Malaysia from being used as a drug transit point,"" he
told reporters here today.
He added that Malaysia was now the target of drug smuggling syndicates,
especially Iranians, while some have daringly set up mini drug processing labs
here.
Zulhasnan said the involvement of Iranians in the smuggling and distribution
of drugs, mainly methamphetamine or syabu, has increased significantly since
this year alone, about 50 Iranians have been arrested for such offences.
He said within two months, 55.133 kilogram of syabu crystals, 6.9 liquid
syabu and four kilograms of cocaine was seized, mainly at the Kuala Lumpur
International Airport (KLIA) and Klang Valley.
""Actually it is not only Malaysia that is facing such problems but other
countries as well. But based on statistics, Iranians constitute the highest
number of offenders arrested here,"" he said.
He said though drugs from Iran are of very high quality, they could be
bought at a low price, thus syndicates take the opportunity to try and make
hefty profits by selling it in Malaysia.
""The main reason why Malaysia is a target for drug smuggling is because such
drugs can fetch high prices. The difference can be up to RM100,000 a kilogram.
""The latest case involving Iranians was an effort to smuggle in
semi-processed drugs in the form of liquid. Such drugs will later be processed
at their own mini-labs here,"" he said.
Drug smugglers normally transit in Dubai and Pakistan while some take direct
flights from Iran.
He said police were also investigating an allegation by Iranian Ambassador
to Malaysia, Prof Dr Mohammad Mehdi Zahedi, that an international mafia was
involved in smuggling drugs to Malaysia using Iranians.
Zulhasnan said at about 1.15am this morning, police raided a hotel in Jalan
P. Ramlee and arrested two Iranian men, seized 200 grams of syabu, 6.9 kilograms
of liquid syabu and equipment used for processing the syabu.
Two days ago, two more Iranians were arrested when they arrived at KLIA with
drugs while on Tuesday, police detained another Iranian man who tried to smuggle
in 4.9 kilograms of syabu.

""Internet is a medium used for various purposes like business, information,

The statement was in response to reports that claimed that there are no
specific laws to control websites or blogs that offer details like how to make

reasons for an increase in drug addiction among teenagers and youths in the

"DEPLOYING UNDERCOVER AGENT TO NAB DRUG TRAFFICKERS LEGAL - FEDERAL COURT
COURT-AGENT
PUTRAJAYA, March 26 (Bernama) -- The use of an undercover agent or agent
provocateur to nab drug traffickers is legal under Malaysian law.
This follows yesterday's landmark ruling by the Federal Court's three-man
bench which held that evidence of an agent provocateur was credible and must be
admitted by the trial court without any restriction, by virtue of Section 40A of
the Dangerous Drug Act (DDA) 1952.
In his 22-page judgment, Federal Court judge Abdull Hamid Embong said that
in the fight against the drug menace, Parliament deemed it fit that an agent
provocateur's evidence must be admissible without any restriction.
""The trial judge is no longer vested with a discretion to exclude such
evidence,"" he said, adding that the court's function was only to interpret
legislations and not to add new elements, particulary when the words in statutes
were clear and unambigious.
He also said it remained that there was no place in Malaysian law to allow
defence of entrapment.
Due to drug activities being carried out with a high degree of secrecy, an
agent provocateur, usually a police officer, would be used to entice or provoke
the commission of an offence, to a suspected drug trafficker for the purpose of
securing his conviction.
Abdull Hamid also said the omission by a trial judge to treat with caution,
the evidence of an agent provocateur, did not constitute a mis-direction by the
trial judge.
The bench comprising Chief Judge of Sabah and Sarawak Tan Sri Richard
Malanjum and Federal Court judges Datuk Hashim Yusoff and Abdull Hamid upheld
the conviction and death sentence of trader Wan Mohd Azman Hassan @ Wan Ali for
trafficking in 1.9kg of cannabis at a petrol kiosk in Kemaman, Terengganu at
1.25pm on April 20, 1999.
He was convicted by the Kuala Terengganu High Court in 2003, together with
Ibrahim Nawang, also known as 'Pak Ya', who passed away before his appeal was
heard by the Court of Appeal last year.
Meanwhile, Wan Mohd Azman's appeal was also dismissed by the Court of
Appeal.
On the facts of the case, Wan Mohd Azman claimed that it was 'Pak Ya' and
not him, who had absolute negotiations with an agent provocateur.
He (Wan Mohd Azman) also claimed that he was merely the driver of the car
and that it was 'Pak Ya' who took steps to deliver the cannabis up to the point
where the agent provocateur gave the pre-arranged signal to the police ambush
team, which subsequently led to their arrest.
Wan Mohd Azman's counsel Hisyam Teh Poh Teik had submitted that an
entrapment had occurred and the High Court judge was required to subject the
highly prejudicial evidence of the agent provocateur to a balancing exercise to
determine the weight of the evidence before admission.
Deputy public prosecutor Ahmad Bache argued that Section 40A of the DDA
recognised the evidence of an agent provocateur.

Benjy was re-arrested and detained under the Dangerous Drugs (Special Preventive

activities in Kepong, the High Court heard today.
Senior federal counsel Najib Zakaria said it was necessary in the interest
of public order to re-arrest him to gather other persons involved with him in
drug activities.
""There was no affidavit evidence by the applicant to show that the police
investigation was not genuinely pursued. At most, the applicant's contention is
his misperception of the genuine effort by the police force to curb drug
related activities,"" he said in reply to the submission by Benjy's lawyer,
Amer Hamzah Arshad yesterday.
Yesterday Amer Hamzah submitted that Benjy's re-arrest and detention were
done to salvage the image of the police who were unable to charge him with
drug trafficking.
Najib is submitting before Justice Datuk Mohd Sofian Abd Razak in Benjy's
application for a writ of habeas corpus seeking his immediate release.
Benjy, the only son of veteran actress Azean Irdawaty, pleaded not guilty to
possessing 0.24gm of methamphetamine in a house at A-6-5 Menara Duta 2, Jalan

Immediately after posting bail, he was re-arrested for alleged involvement

In his application filed on April 8, Benjy named the Inspector-General of
Police, Home Minister and the government as respondents, and also sought an
order that he would not be re-arrested after his release.
Replying to points raised by Amer Hamzah, Najib, who represented the
respondents, said the police were entitled to hold a new conference to provide
accurate disclosure of information which did not affect national security.
Besides, Benjy had failed to reveal in his application any motive or reason
for the police to act mala fide against him, he said.
Najib also said that arresting officer Insp Nur Hazurah Ab Talib had
informed Benjy the grounds of his re-arrest and he had signed a form.
""The applicant (Benjy) was well informed of the grounds of such subsequent

against Chung Sheng Wen, 37, Chang Min Yen, 36, Chang Yun Sheng, 32, and Wu

The four were charged with trafficking Nimetazepam weighing 43.033 grams

The illegal trade of the drug, known as ""ice"" or ""poor man's cocaine""

which assured Manila that such an activity would not be tolerated.
Arroyo had earlier said she would take up the issue with her Chinese

"SHORT-LIVED FREEDOM FOR LORRY DRIVER IN DRUG TRAFFICKING CASE
COURT-SYABU
KUANTAN, Sept 29 (Bernama) -- A lorry driver today escaped the gallows when the
High Court here acquitted him of a charge of trafficking in 753,359 grammes of
methamphetamine (syabu) worth RM270 million in May last year.
However, it was a short-lived freedom for Lee Yong Toe, 48, as he was
re-arrested by the police under the Dangerous Drugs (Special Preventive
Measures) Act 1985.
When delivering judgment, Judicial Commissioner Datuk Akhtar Tahir said the
prosecution had failed to prove that Lee was in possession of the drugs.
He said its failure to call two relevant and material witnesses sealed the fate
of the prosecution case.
""I find (that) the prosecution has failed to prove a prima facie case against
the accused...and therefore, find the accused not guilty of the charge against
him, and order that he be acquitted and discharged,"" he said.
Akhtar told the court the investigating officer in the case had taken the
""obnoxious attitude"" of ignoring all wrongdoings of the policemen, preferring
the matter to be investigated by someone else.
""The investigating officer chose to wear blinkers on his eyes so as to avoid
adding the burden on his investigation into the case, and for this attitude,
action should be taken against him, especially in not noting down the misdeeds
of policemen in the IP (investigation papers),"" he added.
He said, the more important question was whether the accused knew he was
carrying such a substantial amount of drugs.
""The fact which most struck me on this, is that the accused attempted to
bribe the (police) constable with a sum of RM100 when he knew he was carrying
RM270mil worth of drugs.
""At least, two other people who were also caught near the scene were generous
enought to offer half a milion (ringgit) in bribes and this fact, to me, gives
rise to an inference of innocence, rather than of guilt, as it shows that the
accused had no knowledge he was carrying such a substantial amount of drugs,""
added Akhtar.
Lee was charged with trafficking in 753,359g of methamphetamine worth
RM270mil, with another man at large, at 6.45am in Jalan Chenderawasih on May 2,
last year.
The resident of Taman Iskandar, Johor Baru faced the death penalty upon
conviction.

"Chua: Illegal sale of controlled drugs worrying
Source:New Straits Times
SHAH ALAM, Sun. - Health Minister Datuk Chua Jui Meng has described as
worrying the extent of illegal sale of controlled drugs by pharmacists and
doctors.
Between 1993 and 1997, 16 pharmacies and 23 clinic were reported to have
violated provisions of the law by selling controlled drugs like codeine
cough syrup.
This is despite steps by the ministry to prevent the diversion of such
substances into the hands of drug addicts.
Chua said the situation was worrying, especially since the offence was
committed by pharmacists and doctors who were the custodians of drugs
controlled under the Dangerous Drugs Act and Poisons Act.
""Pharmacists and doctors must co-operate with the Government to fight
drug abuse and as such they must be vigilant in ensuring that their stock
of controlled drugs will not fall into the wrong hands.
""Towards this end, any unusually large or frequent orders or requests
for such drugs must be questioned or denied,"" he said at the Malaysian
Pharmaceutical Society dinner last night.
Reminding pharmacists to practise within the law, Chua warned that if
they failed to do so they could be punished twice, once by the court and
again by the Pharmacy Board for professional misconduct.
He said under an amendment to the Registration of Pharmacists Act which
was passed by Parliament recently, speedier dispensation of disciplinary
action was provided for.
If the violation of various drug legislation and misconduct involving
pharmacists remains the same, more are expected to be reprimanded or even
de-registered.
On the issue of separating the prescribing function from dispensing of
drugs between doctors and pharmacists, Chua said the matter was still
being studied by the Government.
While the Government is open minded about the proposal, it has to take
into consideration the current scarcity of pharmacies which may
inconvenience patients if it was to be implemented.
As such, the separation of the prescribing functions and dispensing of
drugs could only be implemented once the ratio of pharmacists to the
population improved to 1:4,500. The current ratio is 1:8,000.
MPS president John C.P. Chang said the separation of the functions
between doctors and pharmacists would be beneficial to patients as they
could be adequately counselled on the correct use of the drugs prescribed
to them.
Currently most doctors do not even dispense the drugs they prescribed to
their patients, leaving the task to unqualified clinic assistants.
""This has led to patients not properly counselled on the use of the
drugs prescribed. Studies have shown that widespread poor patient
compliance is due to inadequate counselling.""

The studies also indicate the drug business has thrived during the

region of about 500 million people are using drugs.

immense. The problem strikes in almost all strata.''

overseeing the Philippines' drug prevention program, even found that 12.3
percent of the country's narcotics officers are hooked on illegal drugs.
A 1996 DDB study reported that police, bus, taxi and jeepney drivers
and factory workers, especially those on graveyard shifts, resort to
methamphetamine to keep them awake during long hours.
There are more than 1.7 million Filipinos who are into drugs, about 70
percent of them between 15 and 29 years, according to the police. In Manila
alone, police reckon there are about 60,000 drug users, and their number is
increasing by 4 percent yearly.
Senior Superintendent Cesar Mancao, a ranking member of the
presidential anti-organized crime task force, said in an interview as many
as 70 percent of the people who commit heinous crimes such as rape and
murder are under the influence of drugs.
Asean studies obtained by Kyodo News show marijuana and methamphetamine
hydrochloride are the most abused drugs in the Philippines and in many
other Asean countries.
Easy to grow and market, marijuana is a favorite crop of poor villagers
and insurgents who want to earn a fast buck. Cannabis use in Cambodia,
Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar and the Philippines is on the rise, the
reports said.
''Herbal marijuana is bought wholesale directly from cultivators, part
to be prepared for export, and part to be processed into hashish, which is
principally for export to Australia, Japan (and other) Asian countries, the
United States and Europe,'' said the Philippine report.
As in other Asean countries, it said drug syndicates control the
smuggling of methamphetamine from China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan.
It said the Philippines has become a major transit point for heroin and
cocaine due to its proximity to the Golden Triangle -- Laos, Thailand and
Myanmar -- and its strategic location in the Pacific and Southeast Asia.
''For heroin, the Philippines serves as a transit point, normally
coming from Thailand, destined for countries in Europe, the Caribbean,
Southeast Asia, Africa and North America,'' the report said.
A similar study by the Thai government described a growing drug problem
in that country due to ''changes in political climate, economic crisis, and
social and technological changes.''
''People involved in drug trafficking such as financiers, producers,
dealers, importers and exporters gain benefit from these changes and
introduce both old and new kinds of drugs to many groups of people,'' the
Thai report said.
The report also noted an increased use of amphetamine and Ecstasy among
young Thais aged 15 to 25. Among the widely abused drugs in Thailand are
opium, heroin, marijuana, ecstasy, cocaine and methamphetamine, which are
also exported to Switzerland, Japan, Denmark, Germany and Singapore.
''Heroin abuse is slowly increasing,'' the report said. ''Presently,
there is a growing trend of methamphetamine hydrochloride abuse, including
(among) drivers, agricultural workers, factory workers and students.''
Malaysian authorities, in a report, expressed grave concern over the
growing drug use, saying illicit drugs -- the 'dadah' problem -- constitute
a serious problem in the country.
''From 1988 to 1998, a total of 164,933 drug addicts has been
identified throughout the country. There was an increase in the number of
addicts in 1998 as compared to the previous year,'' the Malaysian report
said.
In Indonesia, the government reported that in 1998 Indonesia ''marked a
change in the abuse and illicit trafficking of narcotics and other
dangerous drugs...from a transit area, Indonesia has become a marketing
area,'' especially in Jakarta, Surabaya and Bali.
''Indications show that indonesia may become a country for illicit
production of psychotropic substances.''
Brunei authorities said their tiny country is a consumer rather than a
drug producer.
''Controlled drugs are illegally imported from abroad, through either
legal or illegal points of entry. Those points of entry are largely
accessible by sea and land routes,'' they said in a report.
Although there is no evidence of drug syndicates operating in Brunei,
it said most trafficking activities are done by small-time traffickers and
transactions are usually done on a person to person basis.
Cambodian authorities also noted ''a rising trade'' of illicit drugs,
which they blame on the presence of the United Nations Transitional
borders.
''Illegal crossings were possible with subsequent trafficking of
illicit substances into Cambodia and through Cambodia to third countries
and beyond,'' they said in a report, adding that drug trafficking is
rampant in the Thai and Lao border areas.
They reported that cannabis is being sold openly in markets of downtown
Phnom Penh and other major cities with foreigners as customers.
''It is believed that foreign aid provides financial support to their
Cambodian partners in the production of cannabis, enabling Cambodian
farmers to grow marijuana for export to Europe and America.''
But they said amphetamine, a stimulant, remains the most serious drug
problem in Cambodia. Users are mostly wealthy young Cambodians who frequent
in nightspots.
''The high cost of the drug -- 20 to 30 dollars per capsule --
essentially limits the expansion of its use into the wider general
population, which could not afford to pay such prices.''
According to a Lao government report, Laos is often used as transit
point for heroin and amphetamines. Since late 1996, the report said illegal
trafficking of amphetamines increased 10 times from three years earlier.
The Asean studies also show poverty is pushing people in Laos,
Cambodia, Myanmar and Vietnam to grow opium.
''Poverty and the lack of basic services are the main reason for opium
addiction in rural areas,'' the Lao government report said.
In Vietnam, the report said opium and heroin are the main drugs being
trafficked from the Golden Triangle to Vietnam through its borders. In
recent years, it said Vietnam has experienced increasing problems of heroin
trafficking into the country.
''Heroin is being illegally imported to Vietnam from the Golden
Triangle. It is not only used for Vietnamese addicts, but also for transit
to other destinations in the world,'' the Vietnamese government report
said.
Estimates show there are about 95,000 Vietnamese hooked on drugs, with
70 percent of drug abusers under 30 years of age.
In Myanmar, estimates show more than 300,000 are engaged in poppy
cultivation as their only means of livelihood.
Myanmar is included in the infamous ''Golden Triangle,'' and is tagged
as a ''major opium producing country.'' In fact, studies said Myanmar is
the world's second largest source of opiates.
''The fact that most of the clandestine heroin refineries are situated
along the borders with China, Laos, and Thailand shows that most of the key
operators may be from the surrounding areas,'' the Myanmar report said.
Clearly, over the next two decades, Asean needs to do plenty of work if
it is to produce a Southeast Asia free of illicit drugs and their
production, processing, trafficking and use before 2020. -- Oana-Kyodo

"NIGERIAN STUDENT GETS 15 MONTHS JAIL FOR INTERNET FRAUD
COURT-FRAUD
KUALA LUMPUR, 24 Mac (Bernama) -- A Nigerian student was sentenced to 15
months jail after she pleaded guilty in the Magistrate Court here today to
internet fraud.
Peace Okotie, 26, was charged with attempting to cheat an administrative
assistant, Buang Md Sayuti, 42, by claiming that she could help bring in US$1
million reward which he won in a Microsoft 2008 contest, despite knowing that
she could not do so.
Prosecuting officer Azimul Azimi Md Nor told the court that Buang had
received an e-mail, purportedly from Microsoft Internet promotion, informing him
that he had won the money in a lucky draw which was held in Stanford Bridge
Stadium, London, United Kingdom.
Buang responded to the e-mail, following which he was asked to pay
US$2,750 in processing fee to get the reward money.
Realising that it was a fraud, Buang lodged a police report and a meeting
was arranged at 2.15pm at KLCC on Aug 27, 2008, with Okotie, who claimed to be
Mrs Sophia Young.
Police arrested Okotie soon after Buang handed the money for the alleged
processing fee to her.
Magistrate Siti Shakirah Mohtarudin ordered Okotie to serve the sentence
from the date of her arrest on Aug 27, 2008.
Okotie, who was in possession of an expired student pass, also pleaded
guilty to overstaying in Malaysia and was sentenced to four months jail.
The jail sentences were to be served concurrently.

mortgaged the 2.02ha plot for funds as the ""forced sale"" value of the first
plot was not sufficient to cover the loan value and interests.
The forced sale value was RM51,800 while the loan which was approved in
September 1994 was for the sum of RM55,000.
Sahar settled the loan on Oct 23, 1996, said Ghaffar.

"TWO VEHICLE INSPECTION STAFF AMONG FOUR NABBED FOR CORRUPTION
ACA-bribery
KUALA LUMPUR, April 4 (Bernama) -- Two staff of the computerised
vehicle inspection centre in Alor Setar are among four people arrested by
the Kedah Anti-Corruption Agency (ACA) for alleged corrupt practices in
connection with commercial vehicle inspection.
State ACA Director Haji Borhan Bujang said today that the other two
were members of the public who acted as intermediaries of a syndicate to
collect bribes from commercial vehicle owners to help them get their
vehicles passed at the centre.
The suspects, aged between 20 and 30, were arrested last week, he said
in a statement here.
He said ACA officers raided the house of one of the centre's staff on
March 27 and recovered RM20,000 from a cupboard drawer.
The money was suspected to be monthly collections from commercial
vehicle owners who sent their vehicles for inspection at the centre, he
said.
The raid was conducted after a month-long surveillance by ACA and
anti-dadah police officers.
Ganja and cough mixture were also seized in the raid, he said.
Borhan said five civil servants and two members of the public had been
arrested for corruption in the state in the first three months of this
year.
He said two army sergeants from the old airport camp in Sungai Petani
were arrested for accepting monthly bribes from companies supplying ration
to army personnel.
Their activities were exposed with the cooperation of the military
special investigation branch based in Pulau Pinang, he said.
Investigations show that the suppliers bribed the personnel in charge
of the camp's supply depot to cover up the short supply of ration in terms
of quantity and quality.
Two suppliers had been charged and each of them was sentenced to a
day's jail and fined RM3,000, he added. -- Bernama

"EX-MELAKA COUNCIL DIRECTOR CLAIMS TRIAL TO CORRUPTION CHARGE
Court-Corruption
MELAKA, June 4 (Bernama) -- The former director of the Melaka Municipal
Council's valuation and property management department was today charged in
a Sessions Court here with receiving a Mercedez Benz E280 car as
gratification to expidite the approval of a project here.
Zulkipli Kasim, 34, pleaded not guilty to receiving the car, bearing
the registration number WDV 9 and worth RM274,453.82, from Chan Kok Chuang
of Liga Maju Sdn Bhd in connection with a bus and taxi terminal project in
Semabok Melaka.
Zulkipli, who is now a businessman, is alleged to have committed the
offence at Garden City, Ujong Pasir here on April 4, 1995.
Judge N.Rajendran, who set trial for Aug 4 to 9, allowed the accused
bail of RM25,000 in one surety and ordered him to surrender his passport to
the court.
On Monday, Azman Abdul Ghani, 38, a former aide to to the late Melaka
Chief Minister Datuk Seri Mohd Zin Abdul Ghani, was charged in a Sessions
Court in Seremban of also receiving a similar car from Chan in connection
with the same project.
He was alleged to have committed the offence when he was the assistant
to Zulkipli.
Zulkipli and Azman are charged under Section 165 of the Penal Code
which carries a sentence of up to two years in jail, or fine, or both, upon
conviction.
Rajendran initially wanted to fix an earlier trial date but prosecuting
officer Shawal Mat of the Anti-Corruption Agency (ACA) sought a later date
as the prosecution wished to apply to have Azman's case transferred so that
both accused can be tried in the same court.
Shawal also wanted Zulkipli's bail to be RM50,000 with two sureties,
saying the accused had tried to escape arrest by the ACA.
He told the court that the ACA could not serve a warrant of arrest on
Zulkipli at his house on Saturday, adding that the accused's wife and other
family members did not provide cooperation.
Zulkipli surrendered to ACA officers at the courthouse car park here
today.
Christopher Fernando, the counsel representing Zulkipli, had asked the
court to set bail at RM5,000, the same amount as that for Azman. -- BERNAMA

"CONSULTANT ARCHITECT WAS SAHAR'S PROXY, CORRUPTION TRIAL TOLD
MELAKA, Aug 4 (Bernama) -- Consultant architect Othman Kassim was the
""proxy and partner-in-crime"" of former Melaka state assemblyman Datuk Sahar
Arpan in a 1994 land transaction, the High Court heard today.
Senior Federal Counsel Datuk Abdul Rahim Uda said Othman had testified
that he purchased two pices of land in Alor Gajah from Sahar in April 1994,
but the land was registered under Sahar's name only on Nov 1, 1994.
Also, one of the plots was mortgaged on the same day (Nov 1, 1994) to
Bank Pertanian by Sahar and was redeemed on Feb 21, 1997, he said when
submitting before Justice Datuk Suriyadi Halim Omar.
He said there appeared to be some sort of pact between Othman and Sahar
because the stamping on the transaction document was only made in Nov 1996
after the Anti-Corruption Agency commenced investigations against Sahar on
Sept 17, 1996.
Abdul Rahim said Othman was regarded as a far sighted person, yet he
seemed to have bought a piece of land with a lease period period of only
four years.
Sahar, the state assemblyman for Durian Tunggal, 45, is alleged to have
commited corrupt practice by using his public position for his pecuniary
advantage and thereby committing an offence punishable under Section 2 (1)
of the Emergency (Essential Powers) Ordinance No 22 of 1970.

They could be fined five times the amount of money involved or

According to Section 11 (c) of the Anti-Corruption Act 1997 which came

Most of the offenders were illegal immigrants.
He said disciplinary action was taken on 19 government officers, while

"COURT ACQUITS DATUK WAAD OF CORRUPTION
Court-Waad/BM
SEREMBAN, Oct 8 (Bernama) -- Negeri Sembilan state assemblyman for
Gemencheh and former state executive councillor Datuk Waad Mansor was today
acquitted and discharged by the High Court here of three counts of
corruption of using his public position for pecuniary interests.
Judge Datuk Mohamad Noor Abdullah, in acquitting Waad, 42, said he was
convinced that Waad truly believed that his wife Datin Noraini Abd Satar
had no interests at all in Teraju Nusantara Sdn Bhd when the state
executive council discussed and approved the company's application for
quarry land.
Witnesses had earlier testified that Waad sat in at the three council
meetings which considered and approved the company's application.
""On this premise, Waad had not misused his position as state
assemblyman for Gemencheh and as state executive council member,"" the judge
said.
The judge said one should not be misconstrued as having misused his
public office if he was unaware of the vested interests.
The former state executive councillor was charged with using his
position as the Gemencheh assemblyman to participate in a meeting at the
Tampin district office on Dec 21, 1992 to decide on a application by Teraju
Nusantara for a temporary occupation licence to occupy 20.146 hectares of
state land in the mukim of Repah and for ownership of another four hectares
to carry out quarry operations.
In the second charge, he was alleged to have taken part in the
deliberations at the state executive council meeting on April 28, 1993 to
approve an application by the company in which his wife was a shareholder
for a 60-year lease of a 28.24-hectare land for quarry operations in the
same mukim.
In the third charge, he is alleged to have taken part in the
discussions at the executive council meeting on Jan 26, 1994 to approve an
application by the company to extend the premium payment period for the
28.24 hectares by another six months.
All the charges are under Section 2 (1) of the Emergency (Essential
Powers) Ordinance No 22, 1970, which carries a maximum 14 years' jail or a
fine not exceeding RM20,000 or both, upon conviction.
Mohamad Noor said one of the prosecution witnesses, Menteri Besar Tan
Sri Mohamed Isa Abdul Samad had testified that before the state executive
council meeting on April 28, 1993, Waad had stated ""before my wife had
interests but no longer so now. Is there a need to declare the intersts"" to
which he had said there was no need.
The judge said he also believed the evidence of defence witness, the
principal of Sekolah Menengah Gemencheh Zainuddin Madon that not long
before he was transferred to the school, Waad had telephoned him and asked
him to advise Noraini who was a teacher at the school to give up her
interests in Teraju Nusantara.
According to the testimony of company secretary Hisham Baba he did not
file Form 49, for declaring resignation, and Form 32A, for transfer of
Noraini's interests in Teraju Nusantara dated Nov 20,1992 to the Registrar
of Companies because he (Hisham) did not receive the secretarial fees.
The judge said Hisham stated that he prepared the second Form 49 and
the second form 32 A and only filed them on May 26 1994 and had the duty
stamped on May 30 1994, upon being paid the secretarial fees two or three
days before his (Hisham's) wedding on May 22, 1994.
The judge said he was convinced that there was indeed a telephone
conversation between Waad and Zainudin, and also that one of the
shareholders and directors of Teraju Nusantara Wahab Ahmad did go to Waad's
home to obtain Noraini's signature relating to the transfer of shares and
Noraini's resignation from the company.
The judge said there were two elements in the charges against Waad
about the misuse of his public position and about him benefiting from such
act, including pecuniary benefits, which,if proven, could incriminate him.
The judge said although Waad was not found to have misused his public
position, Waad did benefit from the incorporation of Teraju Nusantara on
Nov 4 1991.
The judge said Hisham stated that he prepared the second Form 49 and
the second form 32 A and only filed them on May 26 1994 and had the duty
stamped on May 30 1994, upon being paid the secretarial fees two or three
days before his (Hisham's) wedding on May 22, 1994.
The judge said he was convinced that there was indeed a telephone
conversation between Waad and Zainudin, and also that one of the
shareholders and directors of Teraju Nusantara Wahab Ahmad did go to Waad's
home to obtain Noraini's signature relating to the transfer of shares and
Noraini's resignation from the company.
The judge said there were two elements in the charges against Waad
about the misuse of his public position and about him benefiting from such
act, including pecuniary benefits, which,if proven, could incriminate him.
The judge said although Waad was not found to have misused his public
position, Waad did benefit from the incorporation of Teraju Nusantara on
Nov 4 1991.
The judge said prosecution witness Datuk Rosie Tan, the financier for
Hanro Bina Sdn Bhd which wanted to buy Teraju Nusantara for RM1.1 million,
testified that Waad and Noraini came to Rosie Tan's office in Damansara
Heights in Kuala Lumpur for the signing of the sales-purchase agreement.
As payment, Noraini received RM100,000 while two other Teraju Nusantara
directors and share-holders, Wahab and Milah Harun each received RM50,000.
Rosie Tan testified that Waad also received a RM150,000-loan from Rosie
Tan and Noraini, RM30,000.
The judge said he rejected Waad's testimony in his defence that the
RM150,000 was a personal loan which had nothing to do with Teraju Nusantara
because Rosie Tan had entered in her diary that the loan repayment would be
deducted from the purchase of Teraju Nusantara.
However the deal between Teraju Nusantara and Hanro Bina did not
materialise and Teraju Nusantara was subsequently sold to the Lefturn
company in Melaka.
The judge said it was difficult to accept the logic of Waad's statement
that the RM100,000 Noraini received was later divided equally between Wahab
and Milah.
The acquisition of the quarry land in Mukim Repah was also a fast track
process which was carried out only several months after Teraju Nusantara
was set up, the judge said.
Waad was represented by Christopher Fernando who was assisted by
Ramzani Idris while Anti-Corruption Agency (ACA) Senior Deputy Public
Prosecutor Datuk Abdul Rahim Uda and DPP Saiful Edris Zainuddin prosecuted.
Abdul Rahim was not in court when the judge gave the verdict today.
Saiful, when approached later, said he would refer to Abdul Rahim

LEAD-Court-Muhammad/BM(Pix)
KUALA LUMPUR, June 10 (Bernama) -- Former Selangor Menteri Besar Tan
Sri Muhammad Haji Muhammad Taib pleaded not guilty in the High Court here
today to failing to declare all his assets.
Justice Datuk Chin Fook Yen fixed two weeks starting Dec 7 for the
trial after Muhammad claimed trial under section 25(1) (a) of the
Prevention of Corruption Act 1961.
This morning Muhammad pleaded not guilty to the same charge in the
Sessions Court which then transferred the case to the High Court at the
prosecution's request.
Chin maintained the personal bond of RM10,000 without surety imposed on
Muhammad by the Sessions Court.
He also dismissed counsel Muhammad Shafee Abdullah's application for
further particulars relating to the charge.
Muhammad, 52, is charged with knowingly ignoring conditions requiring
him to declare all his assets and that of his wife children and agents in a
statutory declaration dated May 23, 1997, by only declaring assets worth,
at the time of acquisition, RM10.82 million and A$3.46 million.
The offence was allegedly committed at the deputy public prosecutor's
office at the Anti-Corruption Agency's headquarters in Persiaran Duta,
here, on May 26 last year.
The courtroom was packed with members of the public, Muhammad's family
members and supporters and foreign and local reporters.
Present were his wife, Puan Sri Asbi Rohani Asnan, and his former
political secretary, Datuk Zainal Abidin Sakom, who is now Hulu Bernam
state assemblyman.
Earlier, Muhammad Shafee, in applying for further particulars, said the
facts in the charge sheet were inaccurate, unclear and incomplete.
He said the prosecution should have included in the charge the
conditions which were not followed and the assets which Muhammad had not
declared.
Senior deputy public prosecutor Datuk Abdul Gani Patail opposed the
application, saying that Muhammad had not objected when the charge was read
out and had instead said that he understood it.
He said the charge clearly stated that Muhammad had failed to abide by
the conditions in the notice to declare all his assets.
""What my learned friend is asking now is for us to adduce the evidence
which we will adduce during the trial,"" he added.
Last May 29, Muhammad was acquitted by the Brisbane District Court of
two charges of making a false declaration pertaining to the amount of money
he was bringing into Australia on Dec 16, 1996 and failure to declare
A$1.26 million (RM2.9 million) when he was leaving for New Zealand six days
later.
During the trial, the former Menteri Besar said that he had purchased
properties valued at more than RM10.4 million in Australia and New Zealand
under the name of his wife, Puan Sri Asbi Rohani Asnan.
The properties are a piece of land valued at A$460,000 and a bungalow
valued at A$460,000 in Sovereign Islands, Gold Coast, a farm in Currajong,
also in Australia, valued at A$3.7 million, and two pieces of land and a

"POSITIVE TURNAROUND FOR GOVT FIGHT AGAINST CORRUPTION
SURVEY-CORRUPTION
KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 10 (Bernama) -- The Global Corruption Barometer (GCB)
2010, a worldwide public opinion survey on corruption, has indicated a positive
turnaround for the government's fight against corruption, with an almost
two-fold jump this year.
Malaysian Society for Transparency and Intergrity president Datuk Paul Low
Seng Kuan said that this year, 48 per cent of respondents believed in the
effectiveness of the government's fight against corruption, as compared to 28
per cent last year.
The survey involved 1,000 people in urban and rural areas nationwide from
June
28 to July 26, this year.
""This is a drastic turnaround from the previous year where 67 per cent
thought the government's actions were ineffective while this year, only 20
thought the government action was ineffective,"" said Low.
He said this when disclosing the Transparency International's 2010 Global
Corruption Barometer Results here today.
He said 32 per cent of respondents this year were neutral as compared to
last year's six per cent.
""This positive perception could be due to the government's initiatives to
address corruption through integrity as a National Key Results Area (NKRA), with
improvement of the Corruption Perception Index score from 4.5 last year to 4.9,
as a KPI,"" he said.
Low attributed the formation of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission
with more powers and autonomy and review by independent panels as a reason for
the achievement.
He said the other reason could be the Whistleblower Protection Act which
came into force on Dec 15, to expose corruption by protecting whistleblowers.
Under the NKRA launched by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak in
August last year, the government has set an agenda to fight corruption as the
main thrust.

Selangor Menteri Besar Tan Sri Muhammad Muhammad Taib while Mohamad Fadzil
is the cousin of Murad Ibrahim, who was then Muhammad's principal private
secretary.
Teong was testifying at the trial of the two former senior aides to
Muhammad who are charged with corruption pertaining to an application for a
40ha piece of land in the state valued at RM20 million.
The two are charged with committing the offence at the Menteri Besar's
office, in Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz Shah building here on Dec 20, 1989
but they pleaded not guilty.
Teong said the two nominees signed a deed of debt so that in any event
n that the application did not go through, the RM400,000 must be returned.
The agreement was inked on Sept 7, 1990 witnessed by Shamsuddin and
Murad, Teong said when replying to Deputy Public Prosecutor Julia Ibrahim.
Murad, 46, and Shamsuddin, 54, are alleged to have requested Muhammad
to forward an application for the land situated at Km16, Jalan Cheras by
Jiwa Mewah Sdn Bhd to be developed as a housing estate in which both of
them had an interest. The application was approved by the Exco on Aug 1,
1990.
They were detained by the Anti-Corruption Agency on June 11 and charged
under Section 2 (1) Emergency Ordinance No 22 (Essential Powers) 1970 which
carries a maximum sentence of 14 years' jail or RM20,000 fine, or both.
Teong said after receiving the approval the company appointed Noorina
and Fadzil as shareholders, with 20 percent shares each, in Jiwa Mewah and
with himself holding the rest.
However, Teong said, last year Noorina and Fadzil sold their shares to
him and his brother, Datuk Teck Loong, at RM1.2 million each and made the
payment in stages after paying back the RM200,000 advance payments.
When asked by defence counsel Christopher Fernando, Teong admitted
knowing Muhammad and that he (Teong) picked Noorina as his business partner
due to her experience in the field.
The trial before Judge Sulaiman Ismail continues tomorrow.

"FORMER SIME DARBY GM (OPERATIONS) CHARGED FOR CORRUPTION
COURT-SIME DARBY
SHAH ALAM, Jan 12 (Bernama) -- Former Sime Darby Engineering Sdn Bhd general
manager (operations) in Pasir Gudang, Johor today claimed trial at the Sessions
Court, here, to a charge of soliciting a bribe of RM30,600 for the payment of
three sets of furniture from a contractor, four years ago.
Md Zaki Othman, 49, from Taman Austin Perdana, Johor Baharu, Johor, pleaded
not guilty after the charge was read to him before judge Mat Ghani Abdullah.
He was alleged to have solicited a bribe of RM30,600 to pay for three sets
of furniture, namely an imported sofa set R087, one Dossier dining table set and
a unit of imported Cleopatra chair model 301 from Europe Asia Furniture Expo Sdn
Bhd.
The bribe was for securing a 'Letter of Intent' dated Jan 11, 2008 for the
project 'EPCIC Foe MOQ Package 16, BE Process and BG Utility Platforms' worth
RM23.9 for an oil and gas company.
Md Zaki is alleged to have committed the offence at the Europe Asia
Furniture Expo Sdn Bhd, No: 15A, Jalan Universiti, Petaling Jaya, near here on
Nov 28, 2007.
He was charged under Section 10 (a)(aa) of the Anti-Corruption Act 1997 and
punishable under Section 16 of the same Act which provides for a maximum jail
sentence of 20 years and a fine of not less than five times the value of the
bribe or RM10,000, whichever is higher, upon conviction.
Deputy Public Prosecutor from the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission
(MACC) Nik Azrin Zairin Nik Abdullah proposed that Md Zaki was released on bail
of RM20,000 with one surety and applied for the case to be transferred to the
Kuala Lumpur Sessions Court to be heard together with two other charges faced by
the accused there.
Nik Azrin Zairin, who was also assisted by Deputy Public Prosecutor Hizween
Azleena Othman Kamal, also applied to the court for a gag order on the media not
to disclose the identity of the complainant and the name of his/her company.
Defence counsel S.Vijaya requested for a reduction in bail on grounds that
his client had already been charged in the Johor Baharu Sessions Court and the
Kuala Lumpur Sessions Court.
He said Md Zaki, who was now unemployed, had to support a wife and four
children who were still schooling.
Mat Ghani later set bail at RM10,000 with one surety and transferred the
case to the Kuala Lumpur Sessions Court.
He also issued a gag order to the media not to disclose the identity of the
complainant and his/her company.
Earlier, at the Kuala Lumpur Sessions Court, Md Zaki pleaded not guilty to
two counts of accepting a bribe in the form of two branded wristwatches worth
RM92,980.
On Jan 3, the accused claimed trial at the Johor Baharu Sessions Court to
two counts of accepting a bribe amounting to RM55,300 for assisting to approve
and speed up a contract worth RM23.9 million.

"NAZRI DOUBTFUL WHETHER CORRUPTION SURVEY GIVES ACTUAL PICTURE
NAZRI-SURVEY
SHAH ALAM, June 12 (Bernama) -- Minister in the Prime Minister's Department
Datuk Seri Mohamed Nazri Abdul Aziz is doubtful whether the results of the 2009
Global Corruption Barometer (GCB) reflect the actual situation in the country.
He said the survey was conducted in February when there were many
allegations of corruption involving contestants in the run-up to the Umno
elections in March.
""The survey itself was carried out during the run-up to the Umno elections
in March where many cases involving corrupt practices (involving contestants)
were rampantly reported. I feel this factor, to a certain extent, has created
the public's perception (towards the government's effort in fighting corruption
in the country).
""The outcome of the survey gives an indication as though the people in the
country are still sceptical of the efforts taken by the government to set up the
Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC),"" Nazri told reporters after opening
an MACC Convention at Universiti Teknologi Mara (UiTM), here.
The GCB results showed that 67 per cent of the respondents believed that the
efforts undertaken by the government to fight corruption were ineffective.
The GCB is a global public opinion survey done yearly by Transparency
International (TI) to explore the effects of corruption on the daily lives of
ordinary citizens and the public attitude towards corruption.
Nevertheless, Nazri said, the government would still use the GCB as a guide
to further implement long-term measures to eradicate corruption and instill
honourable and noble values in more people.
""We are not going to set aside the outcome of the survey though we are not
satisfied with it. I am looking at it in a positive way,"" he said.
Nazri said the survey should have been conducted for a period of at least
six months rather than two weeks to reflect the overall public opinion towards
corruption.
He also said that the people were becoming more aware of the role and
functions of the MACC and were coming forward to make complaints on alleged
corrupt practices.

charge on March 4.
Sessions Court Judge Supiah Meon fixed the date for the decision after

Azman, 38, from Alor Gajah, Melaka, is charged with receiving a
Mercedes Benz E280 car worth RM274,543.82 when he was the Melaka Historical
City Municipal Council's Assistant Director for Property Valuation and

He was alleged to have received the car from Chang Kok Chuang of

inducement for the bus and taxi terminal privatisation project in Melaka
and another development project in Semabok, Melaka to be awarded to Liga

Deputy Public Prosecutor Ahmad Bache, in his submissions, said the
court on July 25, 1998 had stated the prosecution had proven its case
beyond reasonable doubt and had ordered Azman to enter his defence.
He said it was Azman's responsibility, in his defence, to raise
reasonable doubts on the prosecution's case and that he (Azman) could not
merely deny the charge.
Defence counsel Christopher Fernando, in his submissions, said Azman,
in his defence, had said that Chang did not give the car, with a plate

He said Azman was only assisting his brother-in-law Najme Khir Mohamad,

but it was no longer interested in the E280 model.
That was the first time that Azman contacted Chang, said Fernando.

demanded by the prosecution was high and that bail was only to ensure the

Senior Federal Counsel Datuk Abdul Rahim Uda, who had been dealing with

He was responding to defence counsel Jagjeet Singh's query on the

Sahar, 44, who is also the Durian Tunggal state assemblyman, is alleged
to have used his public office to his pecuniary advantage by taking part in

"FORMER STATE EXCO JAILED TWO YEARS AND FINED RM60,000 FOR CORRUPTION
Court-Exco/BM
MELAKA, April 19 (Bernama) -- Former Melaka state executive councillor
Datuk Sahar Arpan was jailed for two years and fined a total of RM60,000 in
default six months' jail by the High Court here today on three counts of
corruption.
Sahar, 46, was found guilty and was sentenced to two years jail and
fined RM20,000 in default six months' jail on each of the three charges.
Justice Datuk Suriyadi Halim Omar ordered the jail sentences to run
concurrently, from today.
Suriyadi said that the court was satisfied that the prosecution had
proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.
He said that the defence had failed to rebut the prosecution's case.
""I have no other alternative but to find the accused guilty on the
three charges,"" he said.
Justice Suriyadi allowed the application of defence counsel Jagjit
Singh for a stay of execution pending appeal. The extension of the bail of
RM300,000 was also allowed.
Sahar was however ordered to pay the fine.
Sahar, the state assemblyman for Durian Tunggal, was charged with using
his public position for his pecuniary advantage.
He was charged with taking part in the deliberations of the state exco
to approve applications by Ivory Heights Sdn Bhd (IHSB) in which he had an
interest, for a 60-year lease of a piece of land in the Mukim of Bertam and
another piece of land in the Mukim of Bachang, on Sept 7, 1994, for the
lease of the two pieces of land to be extended to 90 years, on Dec 21,
1994, and for the area of the two pieces of land to be increased, on Aug
23, 1995.
Justice Suriyadi read excerpts of his 183-page judgment on pecuniary
advantage.
He said that the chain of evidence showed that Sahar had pecuniary
advantage from the sale of IHSB.
This could be successfully traced through the two cheques deposited by
Sahar from the payment made by lawyer S.K. Khoo, he said.
""These accelerated payments were actually pecuniary advantage to the
accused,"" he said.
During the trial, the court was told that Khoo prepared the sale and
purchase agreement for IHSB by Othman Kassim to a businessman, Tay Kim
Pong.
Justice Suriyadi said there was evidence that Sahar had purchased IHSB
from Shamsiah Ayub and instructed Mustadza Abu Bakar, a company secretary,
to appoint Mohamed Yusop Omar and Jaini Ahmad as directors.
(The credibility of both Mohamed Yusop, a mandore and Jaini, a hawker,
was impeached during the trial and they were charged for committing
perjury).
""Strangely enough, Sahar had handed over the documentation of Ivory
Heights to Mustadza, rather demeaning for a person with a prominent
position and which can be construed as a running boy of Mohamed Yusop,"" he
said.
The judge said that the process of applying for a government land
involves enormous financial expenses and would have been difficult for
Mohamed Yusop to submit an application.
He said that Mohamed Yusop would have abandoned the idea if Sahar had
advised him against it but the application had proceeded, and later, after
its approval, it took a bizarre turn with Mohamed Yusop relinqushing the
directorship.
Justice Suriyadi said that if Mohamed Yusop had been the actual owner
of IHSB, he would have sought out others to embark on a joint venture.
""The question is why did Mohamd Yusop relinquish his position on a
silver plater without any sen,"" he said.
He said that the sale and purchase agreement for the sale of the two
pieces of land in Machap by Sahar to Othman was manufactured hurriedly
following the investigations by the Anti Corruption Agency.
""I will be blind if I could not see through the intricate web of Othman
and the accused to hide their actions,"" he said.
The agreement which had names of prominent solicitors was prepared in a
slipshod manner, he said.
In mitigation, Jagjit Singh urged the court to tamper justice with
mercy.
""The accused had been bestowed six awards by the state and federal
governments...this case is of unfortunate circumstances, leading from the
application of state land,"" he said.
Jagjit Singh also said that this case was different from last week's
case in Kuala Lumpur where the distinct difference was the position held,
whereby one was from a state and the other having held a position at
federal level.
Senior Deputy Public Prosecutor Datuk Abdul Rahim Uda, in reply, said
that the court should impose sentence to commensurate with the offence
committed.
He said that what Sahar did was a betrayal of the trust placed on him.
Abdul Rahim said that Sahar had abused his high position for his own
interest.
""Such action should be curbed as the people expected administrators
with integrity and honour,"" he said.
Abdul Rahim said it was true that Sahar only held a position in a state
but land matters were under the jurisdiction of the state and the exco was
the highest authority over such matters.
""As an exco member, he was entrusted with a heavy responsibility and
had to meet the expectation of the people but he abused his position and
country, state and the people have suffered a loss as government land was
involved,"" he said.
Abdul Rahim said that corruption cases were difficult to trace and
prove as normally they affected witnesses linked with the accused persons.
Instances of abuse of position were also always not obvious, he said.
""As in this case, the name of the accused did not appear in the
documents and put forward but there were evidence of the accused's hand in
the running of the company,"" he said.
Sahar appeared calm when the sentence was passed. He later shook hands
with his family members including his wife, Datin Ahsenah Othman, and
supporters.
The trial began on June 2, 1997. A total of 69 prosecution and seven
defence witnesses testified at the trial which proceeded for 72 days.

"RICH NATIONS NOT IMMUNE TO CORRUPTION
Corruption-Law
KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 21 (Bernama) -- The rich and mature democracies in
highly industrialised countries are not immune to political corruption as
widely portrayed, a British law professor said today.
Prof Phil Thomas of the Cardiff Law School said political corruption
had often been portrayed by Western scholars as ""occurring elsewhere but
not at home"".
""What is clear is that being a politician in a rich, highly
industrialised and mature democracy or being a rich and powerful politician
in no way reduces the temptations nor the actuality of corrupt practices,""
he said in a talk on ""Corruption and The Law"" at the Help Institute here
last night.
In his 30-minute talk, Prof Thomas also cited various corruption
scandals in western and industrialised countries such as France, Ireland,
Italy, Japan, Spain and the United States.
In Britain, he said, a brief look at the British constitutional history
would show that forms of corruption were deply embedded in its political
life.
""It might be comforting to look at poor and developing nations, demand
their greater adherence to the rule of law and democratic procedures as is
done with Russia and the former Eastern bloc countries, but mature Western
democracies, especially the United Kingdom, cannot afford to be smug over
these important issues,"" he said.
Prof Thomas, who is the editor of the British Journal of Law and
Society, said the United States was not free from corruption either.
""The largest Western democratic nation, the United States, has a long
and dishonourable tradition of political corruption. The slogan `to the
victors the spoils' fits well the political history of that country,"" he
said.
In a wider perspective, Prof Thomas said there was a clear danger that
should civil society lose confidence in the political process itself, then
dire consequences would follow.
""The solution is not to seek to maintain public confidence in an ailing
or dishonest or symbolic political process but instead to constantly revive
the structural elements of democracy in order to preserve that which is
good and replace that which is not,"" he said.
Quoting from the Oxford English dictionary, Prof Thomas said the
definition of corruption included `moral deterioration, infected with evil
and perversion of a person's integrity in performance especially in a
person's official duty or work.
""The definition of corruption remains problematic, particularly for
lawyers, and its exposure offers major challenges for the law enforcement
agencies. Nevertheless, democracy demands our total support and constant
vigilance if it is to work for our collective benefit,"" he said.

"LESS CORRUPTION IN MALAYSIA, SAYS TI
Corruption
WASHINGTON, Sept 23 (Bernama) -- Transparency International (TI), the
self-appointed watchdog group that vows to fight corruption in businesses
around the world, sees less corruption in Malaysia.
The Berlin-based group, whose operation is funded mainly by western
companies and government agencies, including the US Agency for
International Development (USAID), Tuesday unveiled its controversial
annual corruption index ranking Malaysia in the 29th place among 85
countries surveyed.
The 1998 ranking showed Malaysia's position improving from last year's
position at no 32, while its score has also shown an improvement from last
year's 5.01 to 5.3 this year out of a maximum score of 10.
The 1998 TI Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) covers 85 countries with
the ones seen as having the least corruption obtaining scores of close to
10.
There are about 50 countries that do not even achieve a score of five,
and there are numerous countries with a score of less than three, TI
chairman Dr Peter Eigen said here.
The score relates to perceptions of the degree of corruption as seen by
business people, risk analysts and the general public.
Denmark achieved a perfect score of 10 achieving the coveted totally
corrupt-free status for the first time, while Finland came close with a
score of 9.6 followed by Sweden at 9.5, while Cameroon is at the bottom of
the heap with a score of 1.4.
Meanwhile, Singapore led the Asean pack at no 7 with a score of 9.1,
the Philippines at no 55 (3.3), Thailand ranks at no 61 (3.0), followed by
Vietnam at no 74 (2.5), and Indonesia at no 80 (2.0).
Founded in 1993, TI today has more than 70 national chapters, including

they adopt the culture of corruption, I fear they will lose power as the

Loo Siew Fatt, 46, a superintendent of customs, was also ordered to pay

tax licence, at Sumi Cafe in Jalan Lebuh Pantai, here, at about 11.15am on

raise a reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case.
She ordered the jail term to commence from today.
Rosilah however allowed the application by Loo's defence counsel,
V.M.Ravindran, for a stay of execution pending appeal to the High Court.
Earlier in mitigation, Ravindran said that Loo served the Customs and
Excise Department for almost 23 years and had a clean record.
He said that it was his first offence and prayed that the court pass a
non-custodial sentence as he has a wife and three school-going children to
support.
Ravindran said that since his arrest in 1995, Loo had been interdicted
and a custodial sentence would cause more difficulty for his family.

Prosecuting officer Antony Nelson of the Anti Corruption Agency said

"UPHILL BATTLE TO FIGHT CORRUPTION DUE TO PUBLIC APATHY - MACC
MACC-CHALLENGES
PUTRAJAYA, July 25 (Bernama) -- Weeding out corruption is extremely
difficult as detractors feel there is nothing wrong with the scourge while
others argue that it is a necessary evil in the society.
Despite these drawbacks, the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC)
community education division is unperturbed in its anti-corruption awareness
campaign and efforts to correct the wrong perception of the people on the
menace.
""Some people argue that bribes open doors of opportunities in business,
politics or even to gain promotions.
""Offenders often scoff at the ill-effects of corruption on the society in
the long run,"" said MACC community education division deputy commissioner Mohd
Yusoff Akope.
""It will take years before the bad effects of corruption are felt, thus
making it difficult to detect the scourge in the short term,"" he told Bernama in
an interview.
This was further aggravated by the refusal of the people to cooperate with
the MACC, he added.
""Although they want us to take immediate action against offenders, they
refuse to cooperate in providing the information needed. This make our efforts
to fight corruption an uphill battle,"" he added.
Mohd Yusoff said to overcome some of these challenges, the MACC would use
creative measures to attract the public to join its educational programmes to
equip them with the necessary knowledge on how to weed out corruption.
""We may include sports tournaments such as bowling in the programmes to
enable MACC officers to interact with participants.
""It is not easy to educate the public, we must know how to attract their
attention through quality programmes to impart the knowledge they would find
useful,"" he said.
Mohd Yusoff said the public could provide information to the MACC
face-to-face or anonymously through telephone, letters or e-mail at
info@sprm.gov.my.
The identity of informers is protected under Section 65(1) and 65(2) of the
MACC Act 2009 and will not be revealed even in court.
However, they should not share the information with others.
On the face-to-face meeting, he said MACC officers were willing to meet
information providers at their convenient times even after office hours and on
weekends.
Mohd Yusoff said the MACC community education division would update heads of
departments and captains of industries on corrupt practices, systems and
procedures.
""We will hold briefing sessions on corruption for private sector employees.
For civil servants, we will have face-to-face meetings and induction courses.
""Civil servants are aware of corrupt practices but they fall into the trap
as they are either tempted by the bribes or are after quick gains,"" he added.
Mohd Yusoff said more often than not bribery among those in high places were
not as rampant as those in lower ranks who took bribes to ease their financial
burden.
He said the success of the public awareness campaign was subjective as it
was difficult to measure.
""The best defence against corruption is self-control,"" he said.

show a sense of responsibility by reporting the matter to the authorities, and
not just exposing it through blogs, said Selangor Menteri Besar Tan Sri Abdul
Khalid Ibrahim.
He said the state government welcomed such reports to prove the validity of the
allegations of corruption.
""If there is corruption, the public should not just publish these activities
in blogs but must take the matter to authorities.
""I encourage their efforts, but sometimes, stories in blogs are not always 100
per cent true,"" he said in a news conference after launching the 2009 Selangor
Book Festival here today.
Abdul Khalid was asked to comment on an allegation in a blog which linked a
Selangor exco member to corruption activities, and to circumstances surrounding
the death of political aide Teoh Beng Hock.
The blog at http://www.t4tbh.blogspot.com yesterday claimed that the
activities involved more than 300 small projects worth hundreds of thousands of
ringgit, in the state exco member's area.
A blogger who only wished to be known as 'T4TBH' or 'Truth for Teoh
Beng Hock', also claimed that Teoh had left a copy of evidence which was a list
of over 300 projects.
Abdul Khalid said there were blogs created to give negative views on a
target, but hoped each blogger was ethical and made sure information on their
sites were true.
When asked if the state government would investigate the allegations made in
the blog, he said: ""We will monitor it. If the allegations are true, we will
take action but now, we hope bloggers will not become agents for certain parties
as they (bloggers) are considered a group who respect press freedom and justice
to the community.""
Abdul Khalid said bloggers should adopt a gentleman's approach by revealing
their identities, instead of concealing themselves and making allegations.
""However, we will not look for the blogger's identity as it's a waste of
time. We must accept the fact that when we have an open and transparent society,
we will face this situation.
""The people are wise enough to judge what is right and wrong,"" he said.

ascertained. There is no rate for corruption and there is no certainty that
after payments are made there will not be others who will demand for
gratification.
""There is corruption in Malaysia, though it was still at the first stage
during my time, that is, the corrupt officers still hid their acceptance because
they feared being apprehended or they did not like doing wrong openly,"" said Dr
Mahathir.
At this stage, he said it may still be possible to reduce corruption but
when it reached the second stage, becoming part of the people's culture, and
everyone, from the top to the bottom openly expect and accept bribes, little
could be done to stop corruption.
However, he said corruption could be reduced although it cannot be prevented
altogether.
""In Malaysia we insisted in shortening the process and the time for making
decisions. This we did by introducing manuals of procedures for every type of
work, by having work flow charts and desk files for every officer.
""If the time taken to approve or disapprove goes beyond that stipulated in
the procedures we would be able to quickly know that something was wrong and we
would know where the delay had taken place and the culprit involved,"" he added.
He said the result of this system was dramatic and suddenly the city of
Kuala Lumpur grew, investments were approved, factories were built and all the
infrastructure projects took off.
""Admittedly there was still some corruption but not to the extent that the
development of the country could not take place or be grossly delayed,"" said Dr

"FORMER EXCO'S CORRUPTION CASE BASED ON CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE, COURT TOLD
Court-Corruption
MELAKA, July 27 (Bernama) -- The corruption trial of former Melaka
state executive councillor Datuk Sahar Arpan in the High Court here today
was told that the prosecution's case was mainly based on circumstantial
evidence.
There was no direct evidence to link Sahar to any of the three charges,
his counsel, Jagjit Singh submitted at the close of the prosecution's case.
He said the strands of circumstantial evidence built up by the
prosecution had failed to establish its case beyond reasonable doubt.
The prosecution had lost its benefit of direct evidence when its 15th
and 16th witnesses, both former directors of IHSB, were impeached during
the trial, he added.
He submitted that the burden of proof at the end of the prosecution's
case was one of beyond reasonable doubt as the alleged offences were
committed before the amendment to the Criminal Procedure Code which came
into effect on Jan 31 1997.
Sahar, the Durian Tunggal state assemblyman, is alleged to have
committed corrupt practice on three occasions by using his public position
for his pecuniary advantage. The charges are under Section 2(1) of the
Emergency (Essential Powers) Ordinance 1970.
Sahar, 45, is alleged to have taken part in a state executive council
decision at about 10am on Sept 7, 1994, to approve the application of Ivory
Heights Sdn Bhd (IHSB), in which he had an interest, for the alienation of
two pieces of leasehold land in Bertam and Bachang.
He is also alleged to have taken part in the exco's meetings on Dec 21,
1994, and Aug 23, 1995, to approve the extension of the lease and to
increase the size of the two plots of land.

enforcement director Capt (R) Abdul Kudus Ahmad was sentenced to 11 years
10 months jail and RM370,000 fine by the Ampang Sessions Court here today on 24
counts of corruptly soliciting and accepting bribes totalling RM59,000.
Judge Noradidah Ahmad found him guilty after ruling that the defence had
failed to cast a reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case.
The trial stretched nearly six years, starting on Aug 9, 2003, and involved
12 prosecution and 12 defence witnesses including former deputy Housing and
Local Government minister Datuk M. Kayveas.
Kudus, 46, was sentenced to five months in jail on two counts each and six
months for each of the rest but the jail terms run consecutively.
He was also fined RM10,000 for 15 charges each, RM20,000 for eight and
RM60,000 for one. Failing to pay the fines, Kudus will spend another 17 years
behind bars.
Noradidah allowed a stay of executing the sentence pending appeal but raised
the bail from RM80,000 (already paid when Kudus was first charged) to RM150,000.
In her judgement, Noradidah said Kudus's testimony when called to enter
defence was a mere denial and there was no evidence to link Kayveas with the
case.
""Kayveas was called as a witness but it did not help. He only gave evidence
denying his involvement with restaurant owner S. Steven. The accused also stated
that Kayveas had taken part in a conspiracy to bring him down but no police
report had been lodged, so there is a doubt,"" she said.
Kudus was alleged to have taken the bribes from the owner of Sri Steven's
Corner between May 2001 and May 2004. The charges under sections 10(a)(bb) and
11(a) of the Anti-Corruption Act 1997 were punishable with a maximum jail term
of 20 years and fine of five times the sum.
Kudus looked calm in the dock throughout the proceedings.
In mitigation, his lawyer M. Manoharan appealed for leniency saying that
Kudus had to support 10 children and two wives and this was his first offence.
Kudus was now jobless and during the six years of trial, his mother passed
away after receiving numerous threats, he said.
""Other people involved bigger sums but they escaped punishments. Kudus is a
small fry and not a shark. It is unfair if sharks got off and lessons are only
given to small fries by ordering them to serve heavy penalties,"" he said.
Deputy Public Prosecutor Datuk Nordin Hassan recommended heavy penalties
saying that Kudus should have thought of what would happen before committing the
crime. He was a director, the prosecutor said.
He objected to Manoharan's use of ""small fry"" and ""shark"" in the defence's
submission. ""    I feel let us forget this fish business. Charges were laid
regardless of whether you are a shark, scomber or small fry. It is in the law,""

"Malaysian in Internet fraud pleads guilty, walks free
SourceNew Straits Times
STOKE-ON-TRENT, Sat. - One of the four Malaysian students charged with
committing fraud through the Internet walked out free yesterday after he
pleaded guilty in the magistrate's Court on a lesser charge of possessing
stolen property.
Multimedia graphics student Shafik Rizal Shaaban, 24, was given a
conditional discharge for two years by magistrate Graham Richards after he
admitted receiving and selling a computer which was illegally purchased
via the Internet.
The case against three other Malaysian students - Khairul Anuar Ariffin,
28, Cek Norlie Mohd Shah, 23, and Riza Musauwir Riza Salahatin - will be
heard on Dec 23.
Indonesian student Ahmad Yulizar Zam, who had been jointly charged with
them, was also given a two-year conditional discharge after he pleaded
guilty to retaining stolen property.
All five had been jointly charged with conspiracy to defraud several
American companies such as Cyberian Outpost Inc, Amazon and others through
illegal credit card transactions via the Internet.
However, the prosecution agreed to drop the conspiracy to defraud
charge after the defence argued that the court did not have jurisdiction
as the purchases were made from companies in the US.
Prosecuting officer Peter Cooper instead offered to tender amended
charges specific to each person. This would give them an opportunity to
plead guilty.
The case could thus be resolved sooner.
Richards agreed, adding that as the defendants might be required to stay
on in the United Kingdom for another year if they were committed to trial
in the Crown Court, the case should preferably be resolved sooner.
In view of the short notice, Cooper could only tender the amended
charges for Shafik Rizal and Ahmad Yulizar as he needed time to get an
accurate figure on the value of goods for the charges against Khairul
Anuar and Cek Norlie.
In Riza Musauwir's case, the court was told that he was not prepared to
plead guilty.
Shafik Rizal, a final year student at the University of Staffordshire,
pleaded guilty to a charge of accepting delivery of an Acer computer,
illegally ordered by Khairul Anuar from Cyberian Outpost Inc via the
Internet, at his residence.
He also pleaded guilty to a charge of disposing of the computer's
central processing unit, with the help of Khairul Anuar, to a computer
outlet in Birmingham for STG669 (RM4,215).
In mitigation, his counsel Tim Hannam said Shafik Rizal owed his friends
STG1,000 when he met Khairul Anuar who offered to help solve his problems.
His sole benefit was the STG300 he got from the sale of the computer.
What he actually lost was far more. Because of his incarceration, he
missed his final exams and failed the course which he had been studying
for three years. It was a loss of time and money.
He said Shafik Rizal could not sit the exam again as his family could
not support him and it would affect his chances of future employment.
In passing sentence, Richards said he took into account Shafik Rizal's
back seat role in the plan and how his character had been besmirched, as a
result of which he suffered personal loss.
In the other case, Ahmad Yulizar pleaded guilty to retaining seven books
which Khairul Anuar had illegally obtained for him via the Internet by
creating credit card numbers for the transaction.
Richards added that one reason he was prepared to give them a
conditional discharge was their excellent behaviour and record of
attendance in meeting their bail conditions since they were first brought
to court in June.

KUALA LUMPUR: National Parent-Teacher Association collaborative council
president associate professor Datuk Mohamad Ali Hasan said there was no
harm in allowing children to elect their school's head prefect.
""It is not a bad idea. However, I would like to advise schools to ensure
there are no elements of corruption or favouritism when conducting such an
election.
""Otherwise, such values would be embedded in the minds of the children
as they grow up and would affect them when they go to the polls to select
a government,"" he said.
Mohamad Ali was commenting on the election for the head prefect at the
Sekolah Kebangsaan Taman Tun Dr Ismail 1.
Mohamad Ali also urged parents not to get involved in their children's
campaign, and said polling should be monitored by impartial teachers and
headmasters.
He said the candidates should be provided with guidelines to ensure an
ethical campaign.
""If these concerns are addressed, then I think there is no harm if
elections are carried out,"" he said.
A member of the school's parent-teacher association, who wished to
remain anonymous, said the PTA had given its blessing for the election.
""We felt that the voice of the kids should be heard,"" he said.
In other schools, teachers carry more weight in the selection of a head
prefect.

"Political corruption under the microscope
KUCHING: The Performance Management and Delivery Unit (Pemandu) will
conduct a ""mini-lab study"" next month on political corruption in the
country.
This is to enable it to draw up the model for its proposed law, the
Political Party Act, which would force parties to disclose their source of
funding.
The unit hopes the study could be completed within two weeks so
Parliament could study the draft in its March sitting, National Key Result
Areas (NKRA) director on corruption Datuk Hashim Nordin said yesterday in
a question and answer session on corruption to gather feedback from
Sarawakians at the Government Transformation Programme open day here.
Hashim said there was a need for tighter scrutiny and transparency on
the source of funds for political parties.
Hashim said there were serious shortcomings and no holistic approach to
scrutinise the funding of the parties.
""Political parties, as we all know, are under the purview of the
Registrar of Societies.
""But the ROS has all kinds of societies to handle.""
Hashim said the Election Commission could not act against the parties as
it did not have any power to do so.
""The EC can only take action against individual politicians and election
candidates for flouting election spending laws, but not their party.
""We want to study how this act can be holistic, where not only stern
action can be taken against the politician or election candidate but also
against the party.
""In the proposed act, we also want to define political funding, find a
party's source of funding and its political activities.
""People are already asking where these parties get their money to buy
their headquarters, to pay the cost of administering the party.""
Hashim said the mini lab would study the models of advanced democratic

"Tourism D-G acquitted of corruption charge
KUALA LUMPUR: Suspended Tourism Malaysia director-general Datuk Mirza
Mohammad Taiyab was acquitted of accepting dental treatment worth
RM13,860 paid by a company director, without consideration, four years
ago.
Sessions Court judge Zainal Abidin Kamarudin said yesterday: ""The
prosecution has to be careful when it wants to prosecute anyone based on
suspicion as it will not reflect the actual situation.""
Mirza was acquitted without his defence being called.
Zainal in his ruling said the prosecution had failed to prove a prima
facie case against Mirza.
At this point, the public gallery, which was packed with Mirza's family
members and friends, cheered causing Zainal to remind them to be silent.
""It's a gift from the court. Please let Datuk Mirza cherish the
moment.""
Mirza, who was wearing a maroon baju Melayu, looked calm and
expressionless when the judge made his ruling. His wife and several
family members cried.
He was charged with accepting dental treatment worth RM13,860, which
was paid by Syarikat Perunding Pakar Media director Zulhisyam Ayob, 48.
He was alleged to have committed the offence at Clinical Practice
Prosthodontics in Taman Tun Dr Ismail here between Jan 17 and July 26,
2005.
Mirza was charged under Section 165 of the Penal Code, which states
that a public servant is not allowed to receive gifts from those who
intend to obtain something in return involving his duties and powers.
Zainal said the prosecution had failed to prove the element of mens rea
(criminal intent) that Mirza had accepted a valuable thing in terms of
implant treatment worth RM13,860 from Zulhisyam.
He said the prosecution's failure to call Malaysian Anti-Corruption
Commission officer Mohd Zamri Zainul Abi-din, who had conducted an
investigation at the clinic and had lodged a complaint over the matter,
had been fatal to the case.
""Zamri's role cannot be taken lightly. He's an important witness to the
case.""
Zainal also said he accepted the evidence by Zulhisyam, who was the
10th prosecution witness.
Zulhisyam had testified that he paid for Mirza's dental treatment
without his knowledge.
Zainal made the decision at the end of the prosecution's case after 11
witnesses testified.
The crowd clapped soon after the court was stood down.
Speaking to reporters, Mirza said he was relieved and grateful for his
release.
""I have gone through a lot. I was stressed out and humiliated since I
was charged.""
Asked when he would resume his duties at Tourism Malaysia, Mirza, who
was suspended in August, said it would depend on the decision by the
Tourism Disciplinary Board.
Deputy public prosecutor Saiful Hazmi Mohd Saad said he would file an
appeal against the ruling.
Mirza was represented by counsel Tan Sri Abdul Aziz Abdul Rahman and

"GANG SMUGGLING PIRATED VIDEO TO M'SIA
Video-Piracy
NEW YORK, July 1 (Bernama) -- With video film piracy reaching what is
described here as ""epidemic proportions"" -- pirated copies of the latest
Hollywood films are often sold to the public even before the movies are
released.
The American film industry has been exerting pressure on the
enforcement authorities to crackdown on the traffickers of the contraband
merchandise.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which has been quietly
studying the modus operandi of gangs engaged in this nefarious trade,
confirmed that it busted on Wednesday two rings in New York which have been
systematically pushing the trafficking of pirated copies of popular
Hollywood films since as early as 1999.
A total of 13 suspects were nabbed in several raids carried out in New
York. Indeed, some of the suspects were caught red-handed in the act of
making a pirated copy of the just released blockbuster ""Superman Returns"".
The two gangs of video pirates had over the years specialised in
smuggling camcorders into cinema halls and filming the movies. The films
were then forwarded through a network of distribution not only in Malaysia
but also in other countries such as Singapore, Hong Kong and Pakistan.
A spokesman for the FBI did not give details of the specific channels
of distribution but merely said the agency was making ""further
investigation into other related matters"".
Take a walk along the crowded Canal Street in New York's downtown which
is the heart of what is euphemized as Chinatown and bears a somewhat hazy
resemblance to Kuala Lumpur's own Chinatown; this area has become a
veritable paradise for the hordes of tourists zealously seeking cheap
copies of almost any well-known consumer brand product -- ranging from
Rayban sunglasses through Chanel accessories to branded shoes and clothing.
Hordes of American and European tourists are brought everyday to
Chinatown on shopping expeditions. If you look like a typical tourist with
all the attributes of a stranger looking for a good buy, you can be sure of
being approached by a Chinese tout wanting to sell his or her merchandise -
of course, a copy.
US experts say because there is demand, more and more cheap copies of
almost any consumer brand products are appearing in the underground market.
The problem, they argue, starts with the customer who is willing to buy
such products, knowing very well that he is not buying the original.
""Why buy an expensive Rolex watch when you can get a cheap one in
Chinatown which looks exactly like the original but costs only a fraction?
Why see a film in a cinema house when you can get a cheap DVD of the latest
blockbuster and watch with the family and friends in the comfort of your
home?""
This is the psychology or if you want to call it, the logic of the
customer driven to buy the contraband products.
However, this attitude is also resulting in heavy losses to
manufacturers of branded products and film producers and distributors who
have time and again urged politicians and the law enforcement agencies to
crack down on the proliferating street piracy.
Michael Robinson, an expert with the Motion Picture Association of
America (MPAA), has been quoted as saying in the media that the
perpetrators were fuelling a ""big, big underground economy"".
According to the MPAA, the film industry reportedly lost about US$18
billion last year as a result of the proliferating film piracy.
Some experts also wonder how a pirated film copy was available on the
streets even before a film was officially released in the cinema houses.
Phlegmatic FBI experts, unwilling to talk to the media for fear it
would jeopardise their ongoing investigations, have, however, been
suggesting in rare public comments that there could possibly be links
between the gangs of pirates and some ""insiders"".
The cameramen -- referred to as ""cammers"" in the local parlance
-- made clandestine filming of the latest blockbusters in the cinema
halls with the cameras positioned at strategic points and were assured that
they would not be disturbed by anyone while carrying out their work.
According to reports, the movie pirates are paid several hundred
dollars for every film of which copies were produced en masse, and then
sold for a price of up to US$20 by street vendors.
The suspects, who reportedly also worked with gangs in various Asian
countries, including Malaysia, now await trial before a court in Manhattan.
If convicted, they could face prison sentences of up to five years on
charges of violating the copyright laws and trafficking with counterfeit
merchandise.

"POLICE INVESTIGATE INVOLVEMENT OF MAMAK GANG MEMBER IN MICROCHIP CASE
Police-Mamak Gang
PENANG, Dec 2 (Bernama) -- Police today confirmed that the man they
were looking for to assist in the investigation of a case, where a man fled
from a police roadblock in Bukit Mertajam last Tuesday, was a key member of
the `Mamak Gang' known as Khairul Efendi Mohamad Noor.
Penang CID Chief SAC II Abdul Samah Mat said police were looking for
Khairul to assist in the investigaton into several criminal cases.
Khairul had previously been remanded in Simpang Rengam, Johor in 2002
in connection with more than 30 criminal cases and had once been dubbed as
`the most wanted Malay criminal'.
Abdul Samah said police were not ruling out the possibility of the
Mamak Gang being involved in the microchip heist from the MasKargo compound
on Nov 20.
He said police were looking at all angles in investigating the planned
robbery involving about RM100 million.
""At the moment, we are still remanding four men to assist in the
investigation into the microchip heist but they have no links to the Mamak
Gang,"" he said.
In the incident last Tuesday, Khairul and another friend were stopped
by police at a roadblock and after police recognised him, the two were then
handcuffed for detention.
However, a four-wheel-drive vehicle suddenly tried to ram the policemen
and both suspects boarded the four-wheel drive and fled.
Police then fired several shots which hit the driver, but the vehicle
continued to drive on and escaped.
The four-wheel drive was later found in Bukit Merah, in Perak and
police subsequently managed to detain the driver at a hospital in Ipoh as
he was seeking treatment for a gunshot wound on his abdomen.
Abdul Samah said the man was now being detained at the Seberang Jaya

"'UNHOLY MARRIAGE': MALAYSIA-BASED TRIAD GANG, INDIAN UNDERWORLD IN DRUG TRADE
DRUGS-TRIAD
CHENNAI, Sept 4 (Bernama) -- A Malaysia-based triad society is suspected to
have linked up with the Indian underworld to capture a slice of the flourishing
drug trafficking trade in the region.
This startling exposure comes in the wake of the arrest of a Malaysian man
by
Indian police, when he attempted to smuggle out 300kg of ephedrine via Chennai
Port to Malaysia, by faking the contents of the cargo.
The 34-year-old suspect, with a Kuala Lumpur address and unknown occupation,
was picked up by Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) sleuths enroute to boarding a
flight to Malaysia from Chennai last Friday night, after completing his
clandestine operation.
""We found he is a regular visitor to Chennai and was connected to a triad
gang
in Kuala Lumpur.
""He must have been working for a bigger network...we have also arrested two
Indian nationals in connection with the case,"" NCB South Zonal director S.
Davidson Devasirvathan told Bernama today.
Interrogators believe the suspect had procured all consignments locally with
the help of Indian-based drug dealers in Chennai -- which is often used as a
convenient gateway by drug traffickers.
""The suspect had come to Chennai to make a booking of the substance, which
is
easily available in India, through an agent.
""The 'master' (suspect's triad gang boss) is in Malaysia,"" said Davidson,
adding that the ephedrine, filled in 12 drums and discovered at Chennai Port,
was estimated at nearly RM1.5 million in the black market.
Ephedrine, a stimulant substance widely used in Chinese traditional
medicine,
can also be converted to methamphetamine which is commonly used as 'party
drug' and in great demand in Southeast Asian cities among party-goers.
Davidson said NCB, India's elite drug enforcement agency, would get in touch
with its Malaysian counterparts soon to unearth more information on the
Malaysian suspect and the Kuala Lumpur-based triad gang.
The suspects are now being held under judicial custody as investigations
are still in progress.
Two months ago, the Directorate of Revenue (DRI), another investigating
agency, arrested four Indians in Chennai, linked to an international racket
involved in trafficking ephedrine.
The ephedrine was smuggled to China, Malaysia and the Philippines.
In India, ephedrine is a controlled substance under the Narcotic Drugs and
Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 and special licence is needed for its export.

Court-Kidnapping
SIBU, July 6 (Bernama) -- A suspected gang leader and seven others,
tentatively charged with kidnapping a businessman, were today ordered to
remain in the Sibu Prison pending transfer of the case to the High Court.
High Court senior assistant registrar Norhanizah Shaiffuddin, acting as
magistrate, extended the remand of 42-year-old Wong Leh Yin, better known
as Lee Long, and the seven others for another three weeks.
The court was packed with their family members and curious onlookers as
they were brought there under heavy police escort.
Earlier, prosecuting officer C/Insp Hadian Keria applied for a
one-month remand order under Section 177A of the Criminal Procedure Code,
saying that the Attorney-General's consent to proceed with the case was
still pending.
In reply, counsel Orlando Chua said the prosecution should sort out and
expedite the matter at hand as all the eight accused had been detained
since four months ago.
Wong and the seven others, aged between 22 and 37, were first produced
in court on March 9 and tentatively charged with kidnapping Kueh Chion
Huat, 31, under Section 364 of the Penal Code, read with Section 109.
No pleas were recorded. If convicted, they are liable to the death
penalty or up to 20 years' jail and whipping.
Reports said Kueh was abducted from his house at Lorong Lai Chee here
on Feb 6 and confined in several places by a group of men. During his
captivity, he was tortured and beaten.
He was released five days later after his father paid a RM100,000
ransom. Kueh and his family were also said to have been threatened and
confined in their homes by the gang to ensure they did not lodge a police
report.
Wong was arrested on Feb 27 after police stormed his house here at
dawn. He had been detained at the Simpang Renggam Detention Centre from
November 2001 to June 2002 and placed under the Restricted Redidence Order
in Marudi until 2003.

Judge Azman Abdullah made the decision without calling S. Ganeson, 35,

He said Ganeson's counsel, Jagdish Kour had from the start alleged that

""Seen from the angle where the case exhibit was found on the broken

""The position of the case item showed that the accused was not the only

"DEVA GANG CRIPPLED BUT SEARCH FOR LOOT STILL ON
Police-Deva
KUALA LUMPUR, July 7 (Bernama) -- After tracking down the notorious
Deva Gang for 10 years, police finally saw the day of reckoning when the
gang's leader Deva or Devarajan, 42, was captured in Songkla, Thailand on
June 26.
Quick follow-up swoop and brilliant work by the slueths netted in 22 of
its members but the quest to recover more than RM5 million of the gang's
loot is a long way to go.
Interrogation by police shed some light on the group's fail proof modus
operandi that kept them away from the long arms of the law for so long.
Following the success in Songkla, police detained three gang members
believed to be Deva's right hand men in Terengganu, Kedah and Kuala Lumpur
recently and the rest were apprehended soon after.
Police also seized several fire arms including M16 machine guns,
revolver, rifles, pistols and bullets and todate recovered RM800,000.
""This is our biggest success after 10 years striving hard to capture
them. We believe that their reign of terror has ended,"" a high ranking
official from the Kuala Lumpur Police Contingent told Bernama here, today.
""It is a relief for us after the special operation conducted in
Thailand recently. We just waited for the right time to bust them and at
last our headache is over,"" said the official who did not want his name to
be published.
Initial investigation revealed that the gang's modus operandi would
involve 12 men at one time to stage a robbery, while other members would be
on the look out for police patrol cars.
""The remaining ten men would be placed at strategic points of escape
routes as the third eye for the gang to monitor from far and take action if
the main group was in danger,"" he said.
Police have yet to interrogate Deva as he is still recovering from a
gunshot wound in the leg in Selayang Hospital.
The `brotherhood' of Deva was born in the Simpang Renggam detention
centre 10 years ago and the gang became bolder over the years. Since then
they have been involved with 14 cases of armed robberies, luxury-car
hijacking and murder.
But they lost four of their members in a showdown with police in Kepong
on last October.
The gang was said to be responsible for the RM2 million robbery from a
security van at Perdana Siswa Complex, University Malaya, here on Jan 28
and robbed another van transporting RM1 million outside the Faber building
in Taman Desa, Jalan Kelang Lama here on Dec 11 last year.
But their last heist from a security van on June 11, that made them RM3
million richer, probably prompted their downfall. It made the police more
resolute in their efforts to bring them to justice.
The Deva Gang that thought they can never be out-smarted, were finally

Laundering Act 2001 (AMLA) to trace and recover the RM13 million the Deva

Like Malaysia, Thailand is also enforcing AMLA to trace suspicious
transactions, he told reporters after launching a course on economic and

youngest of the three.
Acting on intelligence and public information, police nabbed
24-year-old Mohamad Yuslan at the Bukit Beruntung Toll Plaza parking lot at
11.30 pm on Tuesday.
Petaling Jaya District Police Chief ACP Mohd Hazam Abd Halim said
Yuslan, also known as Achik, was caught together with his 26-year-old
girlfriend in a silver Proton Wira, owned by the girl.
Speaking to reporters here today, the police chief said they were
trying to locate the gang leader Mohamad Yusley, 29, also known as Along,
and his brother Mohamad Yusman, 27, known as Angah.
Mohamad Yusley had nine previous criminal records and Mohamad Yusman
had five, he added.
The three brothers are from Muar, Johor and their last address here is
in Pelangi Damansara.
Police recovered two toy guns from Yuslan and after interrogation, he
led police to a rented house in Bukit Beruntung where a few knives, car
keys, jewelleries, watches, PDAs and sunglasses were found.
Mohd Hazam said the gang masterminded snatch thefts and wayside
robberies and was reportedly using a black Toyota Camry each time they
staged a robbery.
The police are in hot pursuit for the gang since early this year.
He said the gang's modus operandi was by preying their victims before
pushing them in the victims' cars and robbed them. Another way was bringing
the victims to the nearest automated teller machines and forced them to
withdraw money.
""They are dangerous and are on our most wanted list. We need the public
to furnish us details to get Yusley and Yusman because we believe they are
still targeting victims,"" he told reporters at the Petaling Jaya district
police headquarters here.
""Our findings show they are involved in 11 snatch and robbery cases in
Petaling Jaya and 15 in Subang Jaya and we have not gone to other districts
yet...this shows they are really dangerous,"" he said.
The Petaling Jaya Magistrate Court granted remand for Mohamad Yusman
for eight days till Aug 14 to help police investigations under Section 392

Meanwhile, Yusman's girlfriend is in police custody.

"""WAJA"" CAR THEFT GANG CRIPPLED, MASTERMIND ARRESTED
Police-""Waja Gang""
KUALA LUMPUR, July 12 (Bernama) -- The ""Waja"" car-theft gang which has
been active over the last two years has been crippled by police following
the arrest of its mastermind and most of its members recently.
City Deputy CID chief ACP Ramli Din said police also recovered 20
stolen cars valued at RM1.1 million from the gang which were being prepared
to be sold to the unsuspecting public at rock-bottom prices.
Speaking to reporters here today, Ramli said police made a major
breakthrough when they arrested the mastermind at an apartment in
Brickfields here on June 29.
Following his arrest, the department set up a special task force track
the other members of the gang and subsequently 15 more suspects, aged
between 20 and 50 years, were detained around the Klang valley over the
last two weeks, he said.
It is understood the gang was selling off stolen cars for between
RM3,000 and RM6,000 in rural areas in Pahang, Johor, Perak and Terengganu,
to avoid being detected by police.
The cars all had false number plates and the gang even managed to
fasfify the road tax stickers, which appeared almost like the original,
Ramli said, adding that the cars were only sold to people known by the gang
on the guise that their owners were no longer able to continue with the
cars' instalments.
""Sometimes they use the ruse that they are cars were auctioned by the
Customs department. The cars' grants, however, are not given to the buyers
on the pretext they were undergoing the name change process,"" he said.
He said police were also investigating if the gang had ""inside"" help
for their activities.
The cars recovered included 11 Proton Wajas, four Proton Wiras, two
Perodua Kancils and one each Proton V6, Proton Iswara and Nissan Sentra.
Fifteen of them were stolen in the Klang Valley, two in Johor, one in
Penang while the owners of the other two cars are still being traced.
The public who had been approached by individuals to buy cheap cars are
urged to contact the RakanCop hotline at 03-21159999.

the total number of the gang members arrested under the Emergency Ordinance
to six.
Under the heavy presence of security personnel, they were arrested as
soon as they stepped out of the Court Complex at the Sultan Salahuddin
Abdul Aziz Shah building here.
The scene was reminiscent of what happened to another three Deva gang
members yesterday at the court complex after they were freed by the high

Meanwhile, police today obtained a remand order from Magistrate
Suriyanilakma Abd Kadir on another gang member who was detained under
Section 3 of the Firearms Act.
More than 40 policemen, in uniform and plain clothes, were on standby
at the court complex.
Earlier in KUALA LUMPUR, Criminal Investigation Department (CID)
director Datuk Fauzi Shaari when asked on the rearrest of the three
yesterday said: ""The court freed them because the suspects had been held
beyond their remand order (14 days). But we can't let them go just like
that since they are vital in our investigation"".
He said police were currently updating investigations and would submit
their findings to the Deputy Public Prosecutor's Office next week to charge
the suspects.
Todate, seven members of the Deva Gang are under custody to facilitate
investigation.
On June 26, several members of the Deva Gang who had gone into hiding
in Thailand after a RM3 million heist here were nabbed in a special
operation there. So far 22 of the gang members had been detained.
The ""brotherhood"" of Deva was born in the Simpang Renggam detention

they have been involved with 14 cases of armed robberies, luxury-car
hijacking and murders. They lost four of their members in a showdown with
police in Kepong last October.

"RACE-HATE GANG TARGETS VARSITY STUDENTS
Students
MELBOURNE, Aug 16 (Bernama) -- Foreign students at the University of
Newcastle are facing a campaign of racial vilification, with a rising
number of campus assaults blamed on a militant right-wing group, it is
reported.
Police are investigating the assaults against at least four African and
Asian students in the past six months, The Australian newspaper said today.
The attacks coincide with propaganda campaigns at the university by
supporters of the US-based neo-Nazi group National Alliance and the
Australian nationalist youth movement the Patriotic Youth League.
The campaign has echoes of a West Australian race-hate campaign
targeting Asian businesses that led to the arrest and charging last week of
white supremacist Jack van Tongeren.
The newspaper said that Newcastle students have been outraged by the
wide distribution of a sticker warning white women against having sex with
""Black sexual predators"" who ""maliciously spread AIDS"".
Herbert Gatamah, a Kenyan student, told ""The Australian"" he was
verbally harassed by a group of six men at the university bar, one of whom
attempted to choke him.
""They were yelling, 'Get out of my country, you black monkey',"" he
said.
Gatamah reported the assault to police. Two of his friends had
experienced similar attacks, he said.
Police were called to a house in the Newcastle suburb of Jesmond in May
after a group of Asian students, together with a small child, were trapped
inside for two hours as rocks were thrown at the house.
The students association believes the white supremacist push has been
encouraged by the political activity of the Patriotic Youth League, the
youth wing of the far-right Australia First Party, which is based at the
university and has been distributing posters warning students ""Australia's
ethnic identity is being destroyed"".
But the league has condemned the violence and denied responsibility for
the AIDS sticker.

"GANG WAR LED TO TRIPLE MURDER OF M'SIANS, SAYS POLICE
MURDER-EXPOSED
CHENNAI, Nov 20 (Bernama) -- The recent murder of a young Malaysian woman
and
her two children in South India was linked to revenge arising out of a long
drawn-out local gang war, Tamil Nadu police investigations have revealed.
This follows the arrest of six men and three women whom the police believe
could shed light on the killings of M. Adhila Banu and the children.
However, the alleged mastermind behind the killings ducked the police
dragnet
and fled to Malaysia before probably slipping into Singapore, Vadipatti police
inspector P. R. Lakshmanan said today.
He said the man owned a mutton shop and operated a food stall in Kuala
Lumpur.
""(Our investigations have revealed that) It is purely revenge. We have
detained
most of the people involved in the murders but the mastermind has escaped,"" he
told Bernama.
A two-week relentless police probe has revealed that Adhila Banu's family
rivals in Madurai, South India, were linked to the murders after she had vowed
to avenge those who had attacked her husband in Kuala Lumpur, some years ago.
Lakshmanan said the alleged mastermind had assaulted the husband, Muthusamy
alias Mohammad, in Kuala Lumpur where they were previously working.
He said that upon receiving the news that Adhila Banu was planning to seek
revenge (with the help of relatives in India), the mastermind decided to kill
the woman and the children, Mohd Aslam, seven, and daughter, Ajira Banu, five.
The victims were lured from their home in Barathi Nagar in Ramanathapuram
district on Nov 8, and were believed to have been murdered that night.
""She was strangled with her 'dupatta' (shawl) and pillow, and her children
were suffocated with pillows. They were buried in a coconut field which belonged
to the mastermind,"" added Lakshmanan.
Stoked by fear and internal dispute, the gang was forced to dig up the
bodies and dispose them further from the crime scene.
Gang members then decided to dump the three bodies in Kodaikanal, a hilly
holiday resort, but their plans fizzled when the bodies began to decompose.
""They panicked and dumped the bodies in a canal in Vadipatti area and fled.
We have finished our local investigations and will now use diplomatic means to
bring back the mastermind,"" said Lakshmanan.
On Nov 11, Vadipatti police found the three badly decomposed bodies, wrapped
in white dhotis, in a water-filled canal.

KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 28 (Bernama) -- A man believed to be a member of the
Deva Gang, was sentenced to 50 months' jail by the Sessions Court here
today after he pleaded guilty to robbing a security guard of RM2.19 million
in Universiti Malaya campus a day before Chinese New Year in January.
Judge Nursinah Adzmi ordered Tham Mao Hsiung, 36, to serve the sentence
from the day of his arrest on Feb 5.
Tham, a mobile phone trader from Padang Besar, Perlis, was charged with
robbing security guard Mohd Firdaush Daud, 25, of Safeguard Securicor Sdn
Bhd, with three others still at large in front of Kompleks Perdana Siswa in
the campus here at 1.40pm on Jan 28.
According to the facts of the case, Mohd Firdaush, along with three
colleagues, arrived in front of Kompleks Perdana Siswa in a company van to
put money into a RHB Bank automated teller machine (ATM) located at the
complex.
As soon as the side door of the van was opened, Tham and his
accomplices rushed into the van and ordered Mohd Firdaush to open the
vaulting safe and subsequently made off with six black canvas bags
containing RM2.19 million.
Tham and his three accomplices fled in a grey Nissan X-Trail sports
utility vehicle (SUV).
Mohd Firdaush lodged a police report about the robbery.
Acting on the information, the police launched an investigation and
found a black canvas bag together with eight empty cartridges along a
highway near Jalan Klang Gate in Taman Malawati in the outskirts of the
city
They also found the SUV used in the robbery in Taman Sri Ukay, Ulu
Klang.
Further search on the SUV led to discovery of a toothpick on the floor
mat. The toothpick was sent to the Chemistry Department for analysis and
the test showed that it contained DNA profiles of Tham.
Tham was picked up from his house on Feb 5.
He was also charged with knowingly being with some people who owned
firearms on the day and place of the robbery but on Sept 15, he was
discharged not amounting to an acquittal.
In mitigation earlier, his counsel, Hanif Hashim, pleaded to the court
to impose the most lenient sentence on him on the grounds that no one was
hurt in the robbery and that it only caused a loss to the bank even though
the amount was big.
He also asked the court to take into account the fact that Tham had
left school after Form Three and that he had made a mistake in choosing
friends.
Deputy Public Prosecutor Ahmad Fuad Othman said the court should give
priority to public interest as Tham committed the robbery at a university.
The crime had been planned and caused a huge loss to the bank as the
loot had not been recovered, he said.

PETALING JAYA, Nov 28 (Bernama) -- A Parti Keadilan Rakyat (PKR) delegate

gang of four"" in the party.
Speaking when debating a motion on democracy on the final day of the party's
7th National Congress here, the delegate, Ahmad Nizam Abdul Hamid, said if it
was indeed true that the ""gang of four"" existed, it could weaken the party.
""If there is indeed a 'gang of four' in the party, then just wait and see
...
the party will be weaken from within,"" he said.
He did not elaborate who he was referring to as the ""gang of four.""
The term ""Gang of Four"" often refers to the faction which controlled powers
during the era of the Cultural Revolution in China in the 1970s.
Federal Territory delegate Azman Abidin, meanwhile, proposed that the party
increase the deposit for the contest for the division chief's post, from RM20
to at least RM1,000.
He also said that a stricter criteria should be imposed on those intending
to
contest the post to minimise the number of candidates, saying that a high number
of aspirants would make it difficult for the members to choose.
Melaka delegate, Mahani Maspan called on the leadership to take stern action
on
members who created disturbance to the party.
""I hope that the president would not appoint these people to the central
leadership council,"" she said.
She also called on the leadership not to view lightly the acts of those whom
she said had betrayed the party, especially members who supported ""the person
who wants to form a new party.""
He did not named the person.
Youth delegate Erveana Ansari Abdullah urged PKR to sack members who
disparage
the party and those who showed blatant disregard for the party's constitution.
Penang delegate Sim Tze Tzin criticised the plan for a 100-storey Warisan
Merdeka Tower, saying it was a wastage and provide little benefit to the people.
Speaking when debating the motion on economy, Sim said the RM5 billion to
build
the tower could be utilised to build about 160,000 affordable homes which would
benefit nearly a million people.
Sabah delegate, Gan Chee Chan claimed there was a rampant award of
citizenships
to foreigners in Sabah for political purposes.
Johor delegate Yap Kian Giap said PKR needed more experts to scrutinise the
country's economic figures, claiming that the Barisan Nasional government might
be tempted to manipulate them in order to portray a positive growth.
Yap claimed that there had been a decrease in the inflow of foreign
investments to Malaysia.
Meanwhile, a delegate from Pahang called on the leadership to focus on
getting the one million or so voters from among Felda settlers to spur the
party's ""march to Putrajaya.""
Suhaimi Said said the party should provide allocation for its Felda bureau

Najib-Palestine
KUALA LUMPUR, July 1 (Bernama) -- Israeli atrocities on Palestinians
will only render the West Asian peace process more complicated and
difficult, Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak said today.
He said Tel Aviv must respect the international law and the
people-elected government in Palestine though one Israeli soldier has been
kidnapped.
""The Government at the helm in Palestine now is duly elected by the
people through the democratic process.
""This (the kidnapping) does not give Israel the right to violate the
sovereignty and human rights of the Palestinians,"" he told reporters after
participating in the Malaysia Charity Gold Championship 2006 for the Prime
Minister's Trophy at the Kuala Lumpur Golf and Country Club.
Najib said Israel's action in detaining Palestinian ministers and
leaders in retaliation to the soldier's kidnap was overboard.
Instead, Israel must find ways to respect one another, he said.
Asked what action the Organisation of Islamic Conference (OIC) could
take to handle the situation, Najib said it was up to the OIC secretariat

Israel had launched attacks on Palestine territories and detained eight
Palestine ministers of the Hamas-led Government in retaliation to the

"SHARMA AND HER HUSBAND ORDERED TO PAY RM1.8 MILLION TO BUSINESSMAN
Court-Sharma
KUALA LUMPUR, March 2 (Bernama) -- Former newscaster Sharma Kumari Oam
Parkash and her husband were ordered by the High Court here today to pay
RM1.8 million in damages to businessman Abdullah Sani Hashim after they
lost in a defamation suit filed by the latter.
Justice Datuk Dr. R.K. Nathan ordered Sharma Kumari, named as the first
defendant in the suit, to pay damages of RM1 million and Pradeep Kumar to
pay RM800,000 damages to Abdullah Sani, who is the elder brother of Datuk
Abdullah Hishan.
Sharma and Pradeep were ordered to pay RM300,000 each in general
damages, RM300,000 each for aggravated damages and Sharma to pay RM400,000
in exemplary damages while Pradeep RM200,000 in exemplary damages.
This is the second civil suit which Sharma has lost. On Sept 30, last
year, the High Court ordered her to pay RM1,179,726.5 in damages to
Abdullah Hishan, her lover who sued her for breach of contract pertaining
to purchase of 83,000 of Insas Berhad shares.
She was subsequently declared bankrupt after her application to set
aside a bankruptcy notice filed against her by Abdullah Hishan for failing
to pay the damages was dismissed.
She is currently serving a three-month jail sentence for another case,
after her appeal against her conviction and sentence imposed by the
Magistrate's Court last year was dismissed by the High Court on Jan 24.
Sharma was convicted by the Magistrate's Court on July 23, last year of
giving false information to a policeman at the Bukit Bandaraya primary
school in Jalan Bangkung, Bangsar, on Jan 5, 1998.
Abdullah Sani, who filed the suit seeking RM10 million damages from the
couple, claimed that Sharma had falsely and maliciously spoken defamatory
words about him to two policemen at the Bukit Bandaraya primary school area
in Jalan Bangkung, Bangsar, on Jan 5, 1998.
He claimed that Sharma, while pointing at him (Abdullah Sani), has said
""that man and his brother Datuk Abdullah Hishan Hashim tried to kidnap my
son"".
Abdullah Sani said as a result, he suffered damage to his person,
reputation and character and sought general, aggravated and exemplary
damages, interest, costs and other reliefs.
Sharma, in her statement of defence, said Abdullah Sani has suffered no
actual damage and this was an attempt to embarrass her and her husband.
Justice Nathan, in his 30-page written judgment, said both the
defendants well and truely knew that there was not an iota of truth in
their allegation of an attempted kidnapping but yet both maintained that it
was so.
He said the act of the defendants were to his mind raw and unexpurgated
versions of conspiracy.
Justice Nathan said the defendants' decision in electing to submit no
case to answer to the suit, to his mind was a conduct which smacked either
of a false sense of bravado or of a contemptuous disregard to the ultimate
and obvious result.
""There is nothing akin to bravado by taking such a kamikaze stand. On
the other hand, the conduct of the defendants smacked of little disregard
for authority and towards the administration of justice,"" he said.
Justice Nathan said Sharma used the police to prevent service of the
writ of summons and finally ""tried using the long arm of the law to send
this plaintiff (Abdullah Sani) to prison, but alas for the defendants,
""Might is always Right whereas Right is always Might"".
He said that police investigations showed she had made a false report
against the plaintiff and she paid the price for her conspiratorial
machinations.
""But justice is not done with her. The defendants' failure to explain
their conduct and their lack of good judgment in submitting that there was
no case to answer when evidence of their guilt was so apparent leads this
court to arrive at one conclusion only, namely, that the plaintiff has
proved his case of slander against both the defendants,"" Justice Nathan
added.

of up to seven years or with fine upon conviction.
The two, Jong Fock Thian and Choo Sze Kai, both 17 at the time of the

prosecution had no objections.
Lamin ordered their sentence to take effect from Sept 2, 1994, the day

KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 3 (Bernama) -- MAA Assurance Alliance Bhd plans to
increase the contribution of its personal accident (PA) division to 10
percent of its gross premiums from its current five percent within three
years, its vice president for Composite Insurance, Kevin Chong, said today.
For the last financial year, the company earned RM480 million in gross
premiums for its general assurance, out of which only five percent was from
the PA segment, he said in a press conference here today.
He said the company would use its newly introduced ""The Personal
Sentinel"" policy as the champion to achieve the goal of increased premiums
from the PA segment.
""We expect to earn RM25 million in premiums in 12 months time, with an
average of between RM1.5 million and RM2 million per month from this
product,"" he said.
He was confident that the product would be widely accepted as it was
different from other PA insurance products, whereby it included a ""Kidnap
Benefit"", which pays a lump sum of RM5,000 or necessary expenses incurred
including the hiring of a private investigator.
It also offers a reward of RM25,000 for information leading to the
recovery of the policy holder.
Under the ""Kidnap Benefit"", the principal sum insured will be paid in
full if the insured is not recovered after a period of one year from the
day of the kidnapping.
The personal accident policy also pays up to RM5,000 for cosmetic
surgery expenses due to accident. There is also a payment of up to RM500
for the use of wheelchairs and up to RM2,000 for artificial limbs resulting
from accidents.
The Personal Sentinel policy also provides a special card to the
insured, which facilitates his or her cashless admission into authorised
hospitals in the event of an accident which requires hospitalisation.
""There are over 60 private hospitals nationwide which accepts this
scheme,"" Chong said.
Premiums to be paid by policyholders will depend on the potential
policyholder's age and basic sum assured, he said.
Meanwhile, MAA Holding Bhd's managing director and chief executive
officer said the group was positioning itself to be an ""insurance king"" in
the ASEAN region by venturing into five neighbouring countries within five

Currently the company is already in Indonesia and in the Philippines

"SARAWAK COPS RE-ARREST THREE SUSPECTS IN NIYO MIDIN KIDNAP CASE
Police-Kidnapping
KUCHING, Nov 3 (Bernama) -- Three of the six men, who were released in
the kidnap case of Niyo Midin, wife of an Indonesian businessman, by a
Kuching Magistrate's Court here yesterday, were re-arrested today.
Sarawak Police Commissioner Datuk Talib Jamal said two of them were
arrested a few hours after being discharged while the third surrendered
early today.
""We've to re-arrest them for further investigations into the case,"" he
told reporters after handing over 4,500 packets of Hari Raya goodies to
security personnel who will be on duty during Hari Raya Aidilfitri.
The six were released after the prosecution failed to provide
sufficient evidence for their continued detention.
Talib said police believed Niyo, 48, wife of Jutin Lais, was still
alive and she is being held captive in a neighbouring country.
On Aug 24, Niyo and her husband were abducted by four men in front of a
clinic in Bau and brought to an apartment in Kuching.
After two months, Niyo's fate is still unknown though her husband had
given RM120,000 of the RM1 million ransom demanded by the kidnappers to
release her.
On the progress of the amnesty programme for Indonesian illegal
workers, Talib said the response was poor probably they feared being
detained at the roadblocks set up for the festive season.
Since the programme started on Oct 29, only 300 Indonesians in Sarawak
had come forward to return to their country, he said.
The Indonesian Consulate in Kuching had estimated that 40,000 of its
citizens, who had entered Sarawak illegally, would take up the offer to go
home.
Talib assured the illegals that the authorities would not ""disturb""
them on their way to airports and seaports to return home as all parties
were aware of the amnesty programme.
He said Indonesian citizens who had obtained their travel documents
from their consulate here could head for home without any problems, he
said.
The Malaysian police had also been given the nod by their Indonesian
counterpart to be vigilant against middlemen extorting money from
Indonesians working in Malaysia, he added.

"HIV SUFFERER GETS LIFE FOR CHILD KIDNAPPING
Court-Kidnap
SHAH ALAM, Dec 3 (Bernama) -- A contract labourer suffering from HIV
was sentenced to life imprisonment by the High Court here today for the
abduction and wrongful confinement for ransom of a nine-year-old boy two
years ago.
V. Ayakanu, 35, who is jointly charged with V. Parathan and L. Kesava
Rau as well as three others who are still at large, pleaded guilty to
abducting the son of a businessman and wrongfully confining the boy for a
RM850,000 ransom.
The offence was committed at a house in Section 13 here at 1.30pm on
March 4 2005.
Ayakanu was calm when judicial commissioner P. Nallini handed down the
sentence under Section 3 (1) of the Kidnapping Act 1961 (Revised 1989)
which carries the death sentence or life imprisonment and whipping upon
conviction.
According to the facts of the case, the boy was at home when three men
came and told him they had a gift for his father.
When the boy opened the door, the men rushed into the house, bound the
boy's mother and brother and fled with the boy in a car.
A few days later, the boy's father, a ""Datuk"", received a message
through the short messaging service seeking the ransom money for the
release of his son.
A man known as ""Shan"" then took the boy to a house in Penang where he
was looked after by the accused and a few others for nearly a month.
Ayakanu claimed he did not know that the boy had been kidnapped and
that he was promised RM30,000 by Shan to take care of him (boy).
On April 1 2005, the boy's father paid the ransom and was told to pick
up his son in front of a clinic in Juru, Penang.
Ayakanu was told to leave the boy there and was paid RM30,000 the
following day. He was arrested on June 16 last year.
In mitigation, counsel Rabinder Singh, who represented Ayakanu, said
his client was a HIV patient and that his wife and three children, aged
between nine and 14, had left him.
He also said that the case did not involve the use of weapons or
violence.
Deputy Public Prosecutor Wan Shaharuddin Wan Ladin asked for a
deterrent sentence as Ayakanu had been an active player in the incident.
The other accused, Parathan, 54, and Kesava Rau, 49, pleaded not guilty
and are facing trial.

"BRITISH FIRM'S REPORT ON KIDNAPPINGS DISPUTED
Kidnappings
MANILA, May 4 (Bernama) -- The Philippines today disputed a report by a
British insurance firm ranking the country as the world's fifth ""riskiest""
when it comes to kidnapping for ransom.
Press Assistant Secretary Mike Toledo said the report based on a survey
conducted by the Hiscox Group ""did not actually reflect the real situation
in the Philippines.""
The incident where 21 people were kidnapped in Sipadan Island and taken
to Sulu was an isolated case and did not reflect the Philippines' overall
peace and order situation, he said.
In its report, the Hiscox Group claimed that there were 39 abductions,
many of them involving foreigners, in the Philippines last year.
It ranked Colombia as first with 972 abductions, followed by Mexico
with 402 and the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) with
105. Brazil was fourth with 51 kidnappings.
Toledo said the Philippine National Police and the Presidential
Anti-Organised Crime Task Force had already neutralised major
kidnap-for-ransom gangs in the country.
Citing official statistics, he said the number of kidnapping cases had
drastically gone down with only six reported last year.
Overall, the heinous crime volume, which included kidnappings, dropped
by 30.85 percent to only 3,328 in the fist quarter this year from 4,812 for
the same period last year, he said.

"BABYSITTER'S SON LINKED TO BABY'S KIDNAP - POLICE
KIDNAPPERS-POLICE
SIBU, Nov 4 (Bernama) -- Police investigations into last Monday's kidnapping
of a businessman's 10-month-old son whose release was secured on the same day,
has taken a twist.
One of the three suspects detained in connection with the crime, turned out to
be the teenage son of the victim's babysitter who is related to the
businessman.
The 16-year-old was nabbed at a hairdressing saloon where he was employed,
about five hours after the baby was kidnapped about 9.30am.
This followed the arrest of his two accomplices, including another hairdresser
working at the salon, when the duo attempted to collect the RM25,000 ransom
money at Pedada Road.
Sibu police chief ACP Shafie Ismail said today that the suspects had been
remanded till Saturday, to facilitate investigations into the case.
He said that while the 40-year-old babysitter's son was waiting elsewhere,
the other two suspects arrived in a motorcycle, used an imitation gun to
threaten the woman at her house in Hua Kiew Road and took away the baby.
He said they initially demanded an RM80,000 ransom from the baby's family to
secure his release, before it was reduced to RM35,000 and finally, RM25,000.
Having negotiated the ransom, the kidnappers released the baby unharmed at a
building in Tun Abang Haji Openg Road, only to be detained by the police soon
after.
Shafie said the police seized four handphones, two motorcycles and a car
from the suspects, which were used during the five-hour kidnap.

The man's widow also confirmed that the remains were that of her
husband by recognising a watch and a shirt recovered from the scene where

"TWO MEN GET 27 YEARS FOR KIDNAP, CAUSING DEATH OF STUDENT
Court-Student
SHAH ALAM, Oct 5 (Bernama) -- The High Court here today sentenced two
men to a total of 27 years' jail each after they pleaded guilty to two
alternative charges of kidnapping and causing the death of a student three
years ago.
Judge Datuk K. N. Segara ordered Ea Choon Seng, 27, and Yau Boon Hock,
25, to seven years' jail each for kidnapping and 20 years' jail each for
causing the death of the student.
He ordered the sentence to run concurrently from the date of their
arrest on July 9, 2002.
Ea and Yau had pleaded guilty to kidnapping Chan Kwong Wai, 22, at No
1, Jalan RP 4/13, Taman Rawang Perdana, Rawang, at about 6 pm on June 7,
2002.
The charge was brought under Section 365 of the Penal Code, read with
Section 34 of the same code, and punishable with a maximum seven years'
jail sentence or a fine, or both.
Both the accused also pleaded guilty to causing Chan's death at a
forest reserve area of the Forestry Department at Km14, Jalan Batu Arang,
Rawang, at about 5 am on June 9, 2002.
For that offence, they were charged under Section 304 (a) of the Penal
Code, read with Section 34 of the same code, which carries a maximum jail
sentence of 20 years or fine, or both.
They were earlier charged under Section 3 of the Kidnapping Act 1961
for the first offence and Section 302 of the same code for the second
offence.
The charges were amended after the defence submitted a representation
to the Attorney-General's Department.
According to the facts of the case, which were presented by Deputy
Public Prosecutor Wan Shaharuddin Wan Ladin, Ea and Yau had planned the
kidnapping in May 2002, and on June 7, 2002, Ea had asked to meet Chan, who
was his friend, on the pretext of wanting to introduce Chan to a girl.
At about 3.30 pm the same day, Chan went alone in his father's white
Proton Wira Aeroback and both the accused then asked him to drive around in
the Cheras area but he told them the car had run out of fuel.
Both the accused then forced Chan into Ea's car and they went to Yau's
rented house where they bound and gagged Chan.
Later in the evening, Yau took a train to Kuala Lumpur to take Chan's
car and at 10.15 pm contacted Chan's family and informed them that the
student had been kidnapped.
At 5 am on June 9, 2002, Yau bought some petrol and then bundled Chan
into the car boot and drove to the forest reserve area where Ea poured
petrol on the car while Yau lighted it with Chan still in the car boot.
Police found the burnt car and charred remains of Chan at about 7 am
the same day. His body was identified through a DNA test and a post-mortem
found that Chan died due to inhalation of smoke.
In mitigation, counsel Santha Kumar, representing Ea, asked for a
lenient sentence, saying that his client was remorseful and had promised
not to repeat the offence while Yau, who was represented by counsel
Gurbachan Singh, asked to be given a chance to return to society as he had
to support his ailing parents.
Wan Shaharuddin asked for the maximum sentence because Ea had taken
advantage of Chan's friendship and had betrayed the friendship by
collaborating with Yau to kidnap him and caused his death.

suggested to the abductors to allow her to contact her family to ask for
the RM5,000 ransom money to secure her release, the High Court here was
told today.
Tang Sock Boon, 19, said she made the suggestion after one of the
kidnappers, Lim Chiap Lai, threatened to take her to Kuala Lumpur to be
sold.
However, she failed to contact her family as the telephone in her house
was busy at that time.
""One of the kidnappers told me that they were desperate for the money
and I suggested that I contact my friend on condition that I be set free,""
she said when testifying against Lim, 22, an iron smith, and Ng Weng Foo,
23, a van driver, who are jointly charged with kidnapping her.
They are alleged to have committed the offence at Jalan Lebuh Nangka,
Taman Desa Damai, Bukit Mertajam, at about 9pm on June 25, 1992.
Lim and Ng are charged under Section 3 of the Kidnap Act 1961 which
carries a death or a life sentence and whipping.
Earlier, Tang told the court that she was waiting for her father and
brother inside the car parked by the roadside with its engine still running
when Lim suddenly opened the door pointing a knife to her waist ordering
her to sit at the back seat.
""Once I had moved to the back seat, Ng opened the rear left door and
sat beside me while Lim drove the car towards Kampung Juru,"" she said.
During the journey, Ng ordered her to take out her wallet and money
from her pocket.
When she showed her empty pocket, they threatened to sell her in Kuala
Lumpur, she said.
Tang, who was then 16, said she panicked and was scared as the two
kidnappers were wielding knives and often threatened to slash her face.
Tang said she managed to contact her friend, Chew Chin Peng, who
suspected something amiss, when she asked whether Chew had RM5,000.
She dared not ask Chew to contact her family fearing for her safety,
she added.
She said Ng snatched the telephone from her and told Chew where to
place the ransom money and from their conversation, she heard that the
money be placed at the Butterworth railway station.
On arrival at the station, Lim got down from the car for a short while
and returned to inform Ng that the money was there.
""However, as soon as Lim brought the money into the car, a police party
arrested the duo,"" she said.

The Deputy Prime Minister said the incident should not be perceived to

He said this when asked to comment on the kidnapping of three
Indonesians and three Filipinos from the Borneo Paradise Resort at Kuala

Abdullah said the incident occurred far away from Putrajaya, the summit
venue, and hence, there was no question of security at the summit.
""To go to the place, we need to board a flight to Kota Kinabalu (KK),
which takes 2hrs and 45 mins. From KK, we've to take another flight to
Lahad Datu and then go by road to the resort. The place is very far from
Kuala Lumpur and it is nearer to the Philippines,"" he said.

but initial investigations showed they are not terrorists.
""Investigations and operations to search for them will be continued.

Norian-Kidnap
KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 6 (Bernama) -- Six foreign workers, three of them
Indonesians and the rest Filipinos, were kidnapped by a group of 10 armed
pirates from a resort in Sabah last night.
Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Norian Mai said the six who worked
with the Borneo Paradise Resort, Kuala Sungai Sabahan, 39KM from Lahad
Datu, were taken away in a speedboat at about 10.30pm.
""Initial police investigations showed the kidnapping did not involve
any militant groups including the Abu Sayaff,"" he told a news conference

At the time of the kidnapping no foreign tourist was at the resort save
for the six workers as well as a Filipino security guard who managed to
escape from the kidnappers.
Lahad Datu police were informed about the kidnapping by the resort
owner who was contacted by the security guard.
According to the security guard three of the 10 pirates were in army
fatigue, Norian said.
The resort on the banks of the Sungai Sabahan is about 2KM from the
seashore and opened for business less than six months ago.
He said the area was under security control.
The kidnapping occurred in an area close to several islands where
police and the military had clamped tight security control, he said.
The nearest police posts were on Pulau Mataking, Pulau Dulang, Pulau
Timbun and Pulau Adal while the military was on Pulau Pandanan and Bohajan
to monitor ship movements.
Norian believed that the kidnapping could have been carried out by
""local pirates"".
He said the six who were kidnapped were aged between 20 and 50 and
police were trying to establish if they had valid travel documents.
Norian said police believed that the kidnappers would demand ransom and
most probably they were still in Malaysian waters.
The IGP said Malaysian police and military together with Philippine
Indonesia had also been informed, he added.
This is the third kidnapping incident in Sabah since 2000.
On April 23, 2000, the Abu Sayyaf group kidnapped 21 people comprising
nine Malaysians, two Filipinos and 10 foreign tourists from Pulau Sipadan.
The second abduction took place in the following September when armed
groups from the southern Philippines took away three Malaysians from Pulau

Cross-examined by Ranjit Singh, Tang, now 19, admitted she was the one
who suggested to the kidnappers to call her parents to get money for her
release.
She said her hands and legs were not tied and she was not harmed by
them during the three-hour ordeal.
When Ranjit Singh pointed out that she had told the preliminary inquiry
in the Magistrate's Court that the kidnappers had wanted to drive her to
Ipoh, the witness denied this and said that they had wanted to go to Kuala
Lumpur to sell her.

"ONE PERSON SHOT DEAD, POLICE HUNTING FOR 8 MORE SUSPECTS
Police-Kidnap
KOTA KINABALU, Dec 6 (Bernama) -- A 26-year-old man who opened fire at
the police was shot dead at Taman Kim Leng near here on Nov 29 in the
course of police investigations into several kidnapping cases in Sabah.
Sabah Police Commissioner Ramli Yusuff said Tan Kok Han of Kuching,
Sarawak, ignored police warnings to stop and instead opened fire at the
police.
Tracing the events leading to the shooting, he said acting on a tip-off
a crime prevention police team had gone to the bush near the housing estate
to hunt down some suspects wanted in connection with a spate of kidnapping
cases.
On arriving, police saw something moving in the bush and then a man
emerged and started to run while at the same he opened fire at the police.
Police returned fire and terminated him, he said.
Police recovered .38 Smith & Wesson revolver and three rounds of
ammuntion on him and also there were two spent bullets.
Police investigations revealed that the dead man and eight others were
involved in several kidnapping cases in Sabah with the last reported in
Papar.
In the Papar case, Ramli said police had recovered a burnt out human
skeleton.
""We believe that the kidnap victim was a mini-market proprietor who had
been killed earlier and the remains then burnt. We have sent the skeletal
remains for DNA test at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital here,"" the Police
Commissioner said.
Anyone with information on the following wanted persons should contact
Kota Kinabalu Police or the nearest police station.
They are: Wong Chee Kong, I C No I660110-01-6067, of No 78 Jalan Pinang

Sabah Police believe that the local group had links with kidnap gangs
in Peninsular Malaysia and Sarawak and were suspected to be involved in
three kidnapping cases including the one in Papar.
In the first case in June, a housing developer's wife was strolling in
Taman Tun Fuad here when she was bundled up and taken away and despite
being paid a ransom of RM500,000, she was not freed.
Police believe that the woman had been killed as the kidnappers had cut
off two of her fingers and sent them to her husband, the Police
Commissioner said.
In July, a businessman was abducted in front of his house at Taman
Iramanis and then was freed after the payment of a RM300,000 ransom.

"DON'T BLOW UP KIDNAP INCIDENT, KADIR ADVISES LOCAL MEDIA
Kadir-Kidnap
KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 7 (Bernama) -- Culture, Arts and Tourism Minister
Datuk Paduka Abdul Kadir Sheikh Fadzir today described the media's move to
play up Sunday's kidnapping of six foreigners from a resort in Lahad Datu,
Sabah as ""putting sand in our rice bowl"".
He said the government spent millions of ringgit on advertisements to
woo tourists but by blowing up a small story like that into an
international issue would have a negative impact on the country's tourism
industry.
""It will only negate government's efforts,"" he said.
Kadir said the abduction of three Indonesians and three Filipinos by 10
men brandishing automatic assault rifles from the Borneo Paradise Eco-Farm
Resort, 39km from Lahat Datu, was only a minor incident just like robberies
being staged in Kuala Lumpur, but had become an issue and had attracted
international attention when it was played up by the local media.
""This is a crime that happens daily like what happens here. Their aim
is only to get ransom money but has been blown up by the media as though it
is an emergency case.
""The foreign media will take this opportunity to tarnish Malaysia's
image, branding it as an unsafe place to visit.
The media should give a balanced coverage of the incident and not blow
it up to the extent of giving an impression that the situation was not safe
in the country, he told reporters after launching a duty-free campaign.
Kadir said an international study showed Malaysia was among the safest
countries to visit.
""We should project a good image of the country, not publish stories as
though it is unsafe to visit Malaysia, eventually leaving a negative impact
like we shoot our own foot,"" he said.
Almost all the main local newspapers published the kidnap incident as
their front-page story.
Kadir also said efforts to turn Malaysia into one of the world's top
shopping paradise is becoming a reality as foreigners spent RM5.2 billion
to shop in the country.
He said foreign tourists spent 21 per cent of their money to shop in
Malaysia.
The duty-free goods campaign is among the continued efforts by the
government and the private sector to transform Malaysia into a leading
shopping destination in a short time.
""With the ""Malaysia Boleh"" spirit, we're confident our objective will
be achieved eventually,"" he said.
According to a study carried out by the Malaysian Retailers'
Association, usage of credit cards also increased by 30 per cent during the
shopping carnival held in March, August and December, he said.
""During the months, tourist arrivals shot up to 200,000,"" he said.
The study reveals 75 per cent of the proceeds from the sales came from
Malaysians, while the remaining 25 per cent from foreign tourists, he said.
The duty-free campaign is jointly conducted by the ministry in
collaboration with the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry and the
Royal Customs Department to encourage Malaysians and tourists to buy
duty-free goods at shopping centres nationwide.
Among the goods on sale are cosmetics, books, computers, sports
equipment, electronic goods and cameras.
Kadir said Malaysians should look at the duty-free goods which are sold
very cheap.
""We need not go overseas for shopping. Everything is here,"" he added.

"BERNAMA NEWS DIGEST
1.DREDGING UP BAD FAITH
*** KUALA LUMPUR: NST in its editorial among others says: SINGAPORE'S
decision to continue with reclamation work at Tuas and Pulau Tekong reeks of bad
faith. The absence of sincerity is especially telling given that land-filling
continues unabated even as the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea
prepares to deliver judgment tomorrow on Malaysia's application for provisional
measures.
Millions of tonnes of sand are being ferried to the project site, with the
topography of the area changing by the day. Will Singapore be able to restore
the environmental integrity of the Malaysian zone abutting the project, or
indeed the livelihood of Malaysian fishermen, or reverse the impact upon the
ports of Tanjong Pelepas and Pasir Gudang, if the outcome of judicial review is
adverse to it? Surely not, as there is no going back as far as nature and
history are concerned.
The die is thus being cast with Singapore's decision to proceed with land
mass expansion regardless of the dictates of natural justice. It has displayed
scant regard for international law as it pursues self-interest at any cost.
Malaysia, on the other hand, continues to stick to the rules of engagement in
line with accepted international conduct. Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir
Mohamad has little recourse besides considering a protest note to Singapore and
letting the law take its course. Malaysia will continue to deal with moral
rectitude in the matter, as has been our modus operandi since this regrettable
episode began.
The lack of respect for the interests of Malaysia has been evident from day
one when Singapore embarked on the project without Malaysia's concurrence. If
indeed the project is as innocuous as the republic has been assiduously
claiming, making a clean breast of it with Malaysia would have been the first
thing to do. But it has chosen the way of the self-righteous: trampling on the
rights of others out of a false sense of right and wrong.
Nations have to remember that it is often how they play the game of
international relations that counts, not the results at the end of play. For in
the final analysis, it is respect for the rights of others that determines
whether one can belong in a community of equals, says NST in its editorial on
Oct 7, 2003, Tuesday.
2.KIDNAP INCIDENT NOTHING TO DO WITH OIC SECURITY - ABDULLAH
*** SUNGAI PETANI: The kidnapping of six foreign workers by a group of 10
armed pirates from a resort near Lahad Datu in Sabah last night has nothing to
do with the security of the Organisation of Islamic Conference (OIC) Leaders'
Summit hosted by Malaysia, Datuk Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said Monday, reports
BERNAMA.
The Deputy Prime Minister said the incident should not be perceived to have
an adverse impact on the security aspect of the OIC which begins on Saturday.
""This is not the work of terrorists. It is believed the kidnappers want
money from the ransom money,"" Abdullah, who is also Home Minister, told a media
conference after a briefing on the flood situation in Kedah at the Kuala Muda
District Office here.
He said this when asked to comment on the kidnapping of three Indonesians
and three Filipinos from the Borneo Paradise Resort at Kuala Sungai Sabahan,
about 39km from Lahad Datu, at about 10.30pm Sunday night.
Abdullah said the incident occurred far away from Putrajaya, the summit
venue, and hence, there was no question of security at the summit.
""To go to the place, we need to board a flight to Kota Kinabalu (KK), which
takes 2hrs and 45 mins. From KK, we've to take another flight to Lahad Datu and
then go by road to the resort. The place is very far from Kuala Lumpur and it is
nearer to the Philippines,"" he said.
Abdullah said he was informed about the incident Monday morning by the
Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Norian Mai.
He said police have yet to identify the armed group and the victims, but
initial investigations showed they are not terrorists.
""Investigations and operations to search for them will be continued. We've
not received any demands from the group. They'll be arrested soon,"" he said.
The police have sought the cooperation of the Philippines as the resort was
near the republic besides seeking help from the Malaysian army, he added.
3.SIX ABDUCTED
(IGP rules out Abu Sayyaf involvement in hostage grab)
*** KUALA LUMPUR: A group of 10 bandits, some armed with rifles and wearing
military fatigues, stormed a camping resort near Lahad Datu in Sabah and
abducted six foreign workers - three Filipinos and three Indonesians - before
fleeing on a long boat, reports THE STAR.
Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Norian Mai, however, ruled out the
involvement of the notorious Abu Sayyaf group, saying the modus operandi, target
and choice of location were not that of the Philippine Muslim rebel group.
He said initial investigations revealed that the bandits were locals as they
spoke the local dialect.
""An air and sea search, involving the Royal Malaysian Air force Police air
wing, marines, the Royal Malaysian Navy and the General Operations Force (GOF),
has been mounted for the bandits and the captives.
""We are searching all the neighbouring islands and have also alerted our
counterparts in the Philippines and Indonesia to be on the lookout for the
bandits,"" he told reporters at his office in Bukit Aman yesterday.
Norian said the incident happened at about 10.30pm on Sunday and police were
informed shortly after 11pm by a witness who happened to be near the Borneo
Paradise Eco Resort at Sungai Sabahan.
Stressing that the incident was the work of bandits rather than organised
terrorists groups, Norian said it was a big risk for foreign rebels to enter the
country via Lahad Datu because police were stationed on four nearby islands and
the army on another two and they always kept a close watch.
""We strongly believe that locals were involved as the canteen where the
foodstuff is kept was untouched and also because of the choice of people they
abducted.
""If foreigners raid the place they would take the food along because they
have to travel for about 10 hours by boat before reaching international waters,""
he said, adding that it was the assessment of the police that it was a ""kidnap
for ransom"" case, although no contact had been made with anyone, including with
the owner.
It is learnt that the owner has yet to register the place, opened six months
ago, which is located about 1km from the coast and 38km from the nearest town,
Kunak.
The camp has 15 rooms, catering mainly to local tourists, and has campsites
for schoolchildren.
He said background checks were being done on all the six abducted persons to
ascertain if they had entered the country legally or illegally.
The abduction of the six on Sunday brought back fears of the April 2000
kidnapping of 21 people, mostly Western tourists, from the Sipadan resort in
Sabah by the Abu Sayyaf.
*** Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi stressed that
Sunday's abduction had nothing to do with terrorism.
""We do not want certain quarters to analyse and make assumptions, because
this may create uneasiness about security measures during the coming
Organisation of Islamic Conference (OIC) meeting,"" he said.
He said police had taken proper security measures to prevent any untoward
incident during the meeting.
He said there might be quarters that may link the case with terrorism, thus,
giving a bad impression over security measures during the OIC.
He added that initial investigations showed that the kidnapping might be the
work of those out to extort ransom money.
Abdullah stressed that Putrajaya, where the OIC would be held, was in the
peninsula and it would take more than three hours by air to reach from Kudat.
""It takes about two hours and 40 minutes from Kuala Lumpur to Kota Kinabalu
and another flight journey of 40 minutes to Kudat. The Borneo Paradise Eco
Resort, where the incident occurred, is another 29km journey by road from
Kudat,"" he said.
""So, you can imagine the distance from Kuala Lumpur to Kudat. ""Kudat is
nearer to the Philippines than to the peninsula,"" he told reporters after
attending a briefing on the flood situation in Kedah.
4.ARMED PIRATES KIDNAP SIX FOREIGN RESORT WORKERS FROM SABAH
*** KUALA LUMPUR: Six foreign workers, three of them Indonesians and the
rest Filipinos, were kidnapped by a group of 10 armed pirates from a resort in
Sabah Sunday night, reports BERNAMA.
Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Norian Mai said the six who worked with
the Borneo Paradise Resort, Kuala Sungai Sabahan, 39KM from Lahad Datu, were
taken away in a speedboat at about 10.30pm.
""Initial police investigations showed the kidnapping did not involve any
militant groups including the Abu Sayaff,"" he told a news conference here.
At the time of the kidnapping no foreign tourist was at the resort save for
the six workers as well as a Filipino security guard who managed to escape from
the kidnappers.
Lahad Datu police were informed about the kidnapping by the resort owner who
was contacted by the security guard.
According to the security guard three of the 10 pirates were in army
fatigue, Norian said.
The resort on the banks of the Sungai Sabahan is about 2KM from the seashore
and opened for business less than six months ago.
He said the area was under security control.
The kidnapping occurred in an area close to several islands where police and
the military had clamped tight security control, he said.
5. ASIA'S OPINION NOT SOUGHT ON GLOBAL MARITIME MATTERS, SAYS PAK LAH
*** KUALA LUMPUR: Asia's opinion on matters of importance to the global
maritime industry was not sought or well heard despite the region's status in
the global maritime industry and contribution to its growth, Deputy Prime
Minister Datuk Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said Monday, reports BERNAMA.
He said the role of Asia in the development of global maritime policy or
regulation had been somewhat limited and inadequate, either by choice or design.
""Of late, there has been a number of unilateral decisions and legislative
actions taken by countries in the name of increasing global maritime security
and introducing better shipping standards,"" he said at the opening of the 2nd
Asia Maritime & Logistics Conference 2003 here.
His speech was read out by Transport Minister Datuk Chan Kong Choy.
Abdullah cited the United States Customs, which had mandated that shippers
must notify content of the shipment 24 hours before loading.
""Even though it is a good move as it will undoubtedly increase the security
of trade, when the US implemented the new ruling, neither the global shipping
industry nor the government was consulted,"" he said.
""When the European Union (EU) went ahead in July to enforce new rules that
ban certain vessels from the waters of its member countries to prevent the
threat of pollution, they were strongly opposed by the Asian shipping fraternity
not for the content or intent, but the speed and haste of the implementation,""
he said.
Abdullah said Asia should not become a dumping pool for the tonnage that
another part of the world find unfit to sail in its own waters.
""I am sure that was not the intention of the EU initiative, but it could,
however, be an unfortunate consequence,"" he said.
It should be recognised that such a move, if not carried out with the
consensus of the rest of the world, had major implications to the entire global
maritime industry, he said.
Abdullah said the platform offered by the International Maritime
Organisation, which has a global membership, must be the avenue to discuss,
endorse and adopt such initiatives.
He said Asia's voice in the UN-affiliated organisation had not been
sufficiently strong or loud.
""We must strengthen and expand the size of Asia's representation in the
executive council of this highest world maritime policy-making body,"" he said.
""It is my hope that this conference will emerge as a platform in Asia to
give our views and opinions on important global matters affecting the maritime
industry to the global audience,"" he said.
He said Asia was not a region to be marginalised on maritime matters nor was
it the backwater of the world.
Asia's increasing share in global trade had expanded the role and importance
of maritime transportation and logistics services sector, Abdullah said.
In fact, intra-Asian trade now accounted for the fastest growing component
of global trade and was reported to have expanded by about 60 per cent in the
last three years, he said.
Asia, therefore, generated considerable demand for shipping and accounted
for a sizable portion of business generated by international shipping lines.
""Malaysia alone has an annual value of external trade exceeding US$175
billion (RM665 billion), over 75 percent of which is carried by foreign shipping
lines,"" Abdullah said.
As the 18th ranked world exporting and importing country, he said Malaysia
shipped more cargoes than many other bigger countries like Brazil, India and
Indonesia.
Asia also accounts for 40 per cent of the world's merchant fleet, supplies
more than 60 percent of seafarers to meet global demand and handles about 47
percent of the global trade in containers.
There are more globally ranked container ports in Asia than the rest of the
world, with the top five containers ports in Asia and all of them located within
this region.
In addition, he said Asia was also a shipbuilding powerhouse as countries
like South Korea, Japan and China combined to build more ships for the rest of
the world than any other region put together.
Given these developments, it is therefore unsurprising that Asian shipping
lines have been recording the fastest fleet growth in recent years.
""As such, Asia should not be excluded from important decisions that have
direct impact on the global maritime industry. We all have a collective role and
responsibility to play in shaping or re-shaping the global maritime industry,""
he said.
6.ABDULLAH SUGGESTS REVIEW OF SKILLS TRAINING SYSTEM
*** KUALA LUMPUR: Datuk Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi Monday night suggested
that government agencies and the industrial sector in the country reviewed the
country's skilled manpower training system to be on par with the other
countries, reports BERNAMA.
Speaking at the presentation of the Prime Minister's Golden Hands Award 2003
here, the Deputy Prime Minister expressed regret at the poor performance by
participants of the competition.
This was because in some of the skills contested, the level of achievement
shown was lower than the project level specified which was according to the
level of skills contested worldwide.
He said that in the rapidly developing world, what was relevant previously
need not necessarily remain relevant later.
""The methods of education and training we use in this context are no
exceptions. The endless studies that are carried out will ensure that the
training and education that we impart will always be improved in line with the
current needs of the country and industry,"" Abdullah said.
He said the government could build various training institutes and equip
them with sophisticated machines to provide skilled manpower training.
""But if those selected for training and operating the machines are not
serious, we can't become good competitors,"" he said.
The Deputy Prime Minister said that in reality, in the challenging
competition today, the culture that should be absorbed was to reject the
standard of work and services that was lower than the standard of quality
specified.
He said that the level of skill for the Malaysian Skills Competition should
always be adopted as the benchmark in training and industry.
7.BUILD HOUSES SUPPORTED BY TALL PILLARS- ABDULLAH
*** SUNGAI PETANI: Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi
Monday directed all state governments and local authorities to stress on high
ground when approving new housing schemes, reports BERNAMA.
High ground should be the main factor to be considered when approving new
housing schemes, he said after attending a briefing on the flood situation in
Kedah at the Kuala Muda District Office here.
Datuk Seri Abdullah said approval would also be given if the proposed houses
were supported by tall pillars instead of the usual terrace type of low cost
housing.
Houses supported by tall pillars are popular in Sabah especially in Tawau in
the east coast.
He said tall pillars for houses and the high ground factor were not taken
into account previously when approval was given for housing schemes but from now
on these factors would be considered in flood prone areas of the country.
Also present were Information Minister and Chairman of the National Disaster
Committee Tan Sri Khalil Yaakob and Kedah Menteri Besar Datuk Seri Syed Razak
Syed Zain.
Abdullah said most of the houses stricken by floods were single storey
terrace houses built in low lying areas.
Abdullah said these proposals would be discussed at the meeting of Menteris
Besar and Chief Ministers and also conveyed to the Housing and Local Government
Ministry.
He said floods had become an annual problem and they not only damaged houses
and household goods but also posed a threat to life and there should be proper
planning to prevent this problem from taking its toll.
The flood victims stood to lose as they could not expect government help to
rebuild and had to fork out their own funds to buy new household appliances and
carry out repairs, he said.
Abdullah said the situation in the flood-affected areas had become critical
with continous rain and there should be proper planning to contain the
situation.
He said the government would ensure enough supply of food and facilities for
the flood victims.
He advised the flood victims to cooperate with the relief agencies.
Abdullah advised parents to keep a close watch over their children during
this wet season.
On the destruction to the agricultural sector particularly rice fields,
Abdullah said he had directed the Kedah Secretary of State and the Agriculture
Department to assess the damage and the losses incurred by farmers.
Abdullah said 13 Form Three students in Kedah did not turn for the PMR
examination otherwise the examination went off smoothly today.
He said the 13 students could not be reached and it was up to the Education
Ministry to make a decision on the matter.
Abdullah visited flood relief centres in several areas including the ones in
Kampung Jambatan Merdeka, Tikam Batu, near here.
8.BUILD HOUSES ON STILTS, SAYS DPM
*** SUNGAI PETANI: Housing developers wishing to undertake projects in
low-lying and flood-prone areas were Monday told to build their units on tall
pillars or stilts, reports NST.

protect buyers who would otherwise be burdened with the perennial flooding in
these areas.
Abdullah said he would direct State Governments and local authorities to

State CID Chief ACP Abu Bakar Mustaffa said the victim was found in
another house in Catur Avenue where he had been held captive since 11pm

He was believed to have been beaten by his captors as he was found to
be injured and was later warded at the Ipoh Hospital, he told reporters.
The raiding party recovered two sticks believed to be used by the five
men and a jacket belonging to the victim.
Abu Bakar said the police raided the house in Taman Wing Onn following
a tip off at 3am after the kidnappers demanded RM4,000 from the family.
The money was purportedly being payment of something which the victim
had bought from them, he said.
He said the five men were being remanded in police custody pending
their appearance in court to a kidnapping charge.
Meanwhile in another case, a handicapped man was found dead, believed
to be murdered, in Kampung Baru Ayer Tawar, Sitiawan at 8.30am.
Abu Bakar said plantation worker A.Agambaran, 31, was found dead with
stab wounds on his chest and neck.

"SABAH'S EAST COAST ENTHRALLS MPs AND SENATORS ALIKE
Ops Pasir-MP
PULAU MABUL,Sabah, May 10 (Bernama) -- Some 40 members of the Dewan
Rakyat and Dewan Negara today ended their three-day tour of the Sabah east
coast where a military operation codenamed ""Ops Pasir"" is in progress.
They left the area this morning very much impressed with the security
deployment in place along the state's border from Kudat in the north way
down to Semporna waters in the south.
Throughout the three-day visit, they not only witnessed a demonstration
of rescuing hostages on Pulau Pandanan but also gained better insight into
the state's vast east coast waters.
They now better appreciated the problems faced in protecting the east
coast.
Gelang Patah MP Chang See Ten said, ""It has been a very fruitful
visit...if I had not come to this place, I will not know in detail several
of the things happening here.""
Chang said after seeing for himself, he was now very much impressed by
the work put up by the security forces in the area.
Ops Pasir, a multi-agency security operation, was launched in September
2000 following two kidnap-for-ransom incidents on Pulau Sipadan and Pulau
Pandanan.
The operation -- so named in conjunction with the second kidnapping
incident on Pandanan Semporna Island Resort or Pasir in short -- involved
the deployment of troops on remote islands and forward locations to keep
intruders at bay.
Besides the three branches of the armed forces, the operation also
involves the various sections of the police force as well as related
agencies such as customs, fisheries and marine department.
Tambunan MP Datuk Joseph Pairin Kitingan, who is also the president of
Parti Bersatu Sabah (PBS), said the visit deepened their knowledge of the
security operations in the area.
""This visit has given us a broad knowledge of the security operation in
this area. We are now confident that security has been restored fully in
this area,"" Pairin said.
He said the security measures enforced here showed that the Federal
Government was seriously concerned over the problems faced by the people.
Pairin was accompanied by two PBS deputy presidents -- Dr Maximus
Ongkili (Bandau) and Dr Yee Moh Chai (Tanjung Aru).
The visit by the large number of elected representatives to the area
reflected their confidence in the security situation in the east coast, he
added.
""We have full confidence in our security forces and so we are not
hesitating to move around together,"" Pairin said.
Wanita Chief of the United Pasokmomogun Kadazandusun Murut Organisation
(Upko) Senator Datuk Christine Van Houtten said she was glad that she came
as the trip had proved to be very enlightening.
""Those who are not here have really missed a lot of things,"" she said.
Senator Ratnam Muthiah said, ""We are very satisfied. We see the army
and the police are in full control of the situation. We are happy the ares
is being well guarded. Many thanks to the Defence Ministry for organising
this trip.""
The VIPs arrived in two C130 military transport aircraft at the new
Tawau Airport on Wednesday afternoon and then travelled to Semporna, about
100km away, on a tour coach.
They were then taken to the Ops Pasir locations yesterday morning on
several speed boats and sometime onboard military assault boats that
cruised effortlessly on the calm sea.
They were served breakfast and lunch on board the warship, the KD
Mahawangsa.
After witnessing the exercise to rescue hostages on Pulau Pandanan, the
VIPs were taken to Pulau Danawan for a full military briefing before
proceeding to the resort-island of Pulau Mabul for an overnight stay.
After reaching Pulau Mabul at about 4pm, they had the option whether to
rest or take another boat ride to the world premier dive site, the famous
Sipadan Island.
Despite the soaring heat and tiring trip in the previous hours, they
were in high spirits and decided to forego their rest to proceed to
Sipadan, a 20 minute boat ride, for a tour of the beautiful island.
The hands-on tour of the Ops Pasir area had undoubtedly left them much
informed.

"LIBYA CONDEMNS ABU SAYYAF'S KIDNAPPING
Hostage-Libya
MANILA, June 10 (Bernama) -- Libya has joined other Muslim countries in
condemning as ""un-Islamic"" the latest kidnapping by an Islamic extremist
group in southern Philippines.
Libya's strong reaction was conveyed by its President Muammar Gaddafi
in his telephone conversation on Saturday night with his Philippine
counterpart Gloria Arroyo, presidential spokesman Rigoberto Tiglao said.
In a statement today, Tiglao said Gaddafi also expressed full support
to the Philippine government's no-ransom policy against the Abu Sayyaf
bandits.
The group, which seeks to establish an Islamic state in Mindanao,
seized last May 27 three Americans and 10 Filipinos from a resort and took
them to Basilan, 1,000km south of here.
The kidnap-for-ransom incident was the second the Abu Sayyaf mounted in
over a year. The first involved mostly foreign tourists last year in
Malaysia's Sipadan resort.
Tiglao said Gaddafi told Arroyo that Libya ""is available for whatever
help the Philippines would need and ask for"" to end the hostage crisis in
Basilan.
Libya played a key role last year in negotiating for the release of the
western hostages in Sulu after hefty ransoms were reportedly shelled out to
the terrorist band.
Arroyo had ordered a full-scale military operations against the bandits
and rejected their demand that Malaysia help in the negotiations.
Gaddafi also hailed Arroyo for accepting Libya's offer to host the
coming peace talks between the Philippine government and the separatist
Moro Islamic Liberation Front.

First Secretary Mohd Nazri Abdul Karim, contacted in Harare by

view of the ""fluid"" situation in Angola. Angola is about three hours away

Bukit Aman CID Director Datuk Salleh Mat Som said in an operation code

""They did not stop at the roadblock and instead the Pajero V6 bearing
registration number WDL 737 sped away,"" he said.
However it skidded and overturned at Batu 7 1/2 and the two men emerged
from the vehicle and opened fire at the pursuing police.
""One of them used a pump gun while the other used a semi-automatic

RM850,000 and assisting to abduct, confine and detain the victim.
He was accused of committing the offence at a house in Section 13 here,
about 1pm on April 1, 2005 and was charged under Section 6 of the Kidnapping Act
1961, which carries a maximum of 10 years' jail and whipping.
Kesava Rau was previously charged with kidnapping the boy under Section 3 of
the same act, which carries the death penalty or a jail up to 20 years and
whiping, if convicted.
In his judgment, Mohd Yazid said the facts of the case were important
because based on the testimonies of 13 prosecution witnesses, the accused was
not among the three people who entered the victim's house for the kidnapping.
He said the handwriting specialist, in his testimony, had also verified that
the ransom note sent to the victim's family before he was released, was written
by the accused.
""We found the role played by the accused based on the accounts witnesses
necessitated the charge to be amended.
""In normal kidnapping cases, public interest is the main factor for the
court to decide on the case but it must be balanced by the facts of the case.
""The fact that the accused's father died of heart attack soon after he was
informed by the police about his son's involvement in the case should also be
considered by the court in passing sentence,"" he added.
In mitigation, Kesava's counsel S.S.Seelan said that his client had repented
and was sorry for his wrongdoing.
""Because of his wrongdoing, his father died of a heart attack immediately
after he was informed that his son (Kesava Rau) was arrested for kidnapping.
This is the price that the accused has had to pay. Therefore, we hope that the
court would pass a lenient punishment and give the accused another chance,"" he
said.
Deputy public prosecutor Mohd Nordin Ismail, however, had urged the court to
mete out a harsh sentence as the suffering of the victim's family should be
considered.
""The case involves many people and a mistake by the accused had caused
misery to them. So we hope the court will pass heavier sentence in the public
interest,"" he said.

"WOMAN AMONG FOUR PEOPLE JAILED FOR KIDNAPPING
Court-Kidnap/BM
SHAH ALAM, Nov 11 (Bernama) -- Four people, including a woman, were
jailed for three-and-a-half years by the High Court here today for
kidnapping a six-year-old boy for a RM300,000 ransom.
R. Vasanthi, 21, K.S.Mohandas, 41, M.Jegathisan, 24, and S.
Nasirlakumar, 23, admitted committing the offence in front of a house in
SS19/4A, Subang Jaya, at 8.10am on Oct 27 last year.
They pleaded guilty after the prosecution amended the charge from one
under section 3 of the Kidnapping Act, which carries the death sentence or
life imprisonment, to one under section 363 of the Penal Code, which
carries a maximum seven years jail and is liable to a fine, upon
conviction.
Justice Datuk Kang Hwee Gee ordered their sentences to run from their
Jegathisan and Nov 5 for Nasirlakumar.
Assistant public prosecutor Nur Izzaini Ishak told the court that the
boy was on his way to the Eden kindergarten accompanied by his aunt when a
man in a car pushed her aside and dragged him into the car.
The boy's father, Habib Rahuman Aboo Bakar, a businessman later
reported to the police that he had received several telephone calls
demanding RM300,000 as ransom.
On Oct 31 last year, Habib Rahuman, was instructed to bring the money
to Jalan Loke Yew and to send his nephew to a bus stop in Klang to pick up
the victim.
Nur Izzaini said the money was picked up by Vasanthi and her husband
later lodged a report at the Cheras police station that he had found it.
The couple was detained and the boy was released in front of the Leela
Ratos Clinic in Jalan Pudu, Kuala Lumpur at 4am on Nov 1.
Police detained Mohandas the same day while Jegathisan and Nasirlakumar
surrendered themselves a few days later.
Nur Izzaini said police investigations showed that the boy was confined
in a house in Taman Kinrara which was rented by Jegathisan while the room
where he was confined was sub-let to Vasanthi and Mohandas.
The four were identified by the boy in an identification parade while
Nasirlakumar was identified by the boy's aunt as the man who dragged him
into the car. Habib Rahuman identified Jegathisan as the man who made the
ransom demand from his voice.
In mitigation, Vasanthi, a former clerk represented by counsel S.Bala,
said she was influenced to commit the offence by Mohandas with whom she was
having an affair.
Bala said Vasanthi's role was only to look after the boy and she had
repented after having lost the child that she was carrying while under
police detention.
The other three also pleaded for leniency, saying that they had
repented and apologising to the boy and his parents.
The judge ordered that the ransom money be returned to Habib Rahuman.

"SIX 'NOVICE KIDNAPPERS' HELD IN TWO KIDNAP CASES
POLICE-KIDNAP
SEREMBAN, Nov 11 (Bernama) -- Negeri Sembilan police have crippled a gang of
what appeared to be 'novice kidnappers', with the arrest of five youths and a
woman.
The suspects, who are unemployed, were linked to a kidnapping on Sept 19,
and
another, 10 days later.
They had used the same house in Taman Seremban Jaya to hold two kidnap
victims
captive on separate occassions.
While they demanded and got a RM5,000 ransom for the release of their first
victim, their demand for RM150,000 ransom to release the second victim did not
bear fruit.
The second victim was freed, nevertheless.
State police chief Datuk Osman Salleh said the suspects, aged between 23 and
32, were picked up in separate operations in Seremban Jaya, south Seremban,
Klang and Shah Alam over the past two weeks.
He said in the first case which occurred near a shopping complex here on
Sept
19, four youths confronted a man and threatened him with a machete.
Osman said the 32-year-old victim was dragged into a car and taken to a
house in Taman Seremban Jaya where he was held captive.
""The suspects later contacted the victim's brother and demanded for a
RM5,000 ransom to secure his release.
""The victim's brother paid the ransom before the man was released at the
Plus Highway near the Labu toll plaza,"" he said in a media conference here
today.
In the second case, also at Taman Seremban Jaya, a 26-year-old woman was on
her way to work on a motorcycle when she was hit by a car.
Osman said, four men alighted from the car and dragged the victim, who
sustained a broken shoulder, into the vehicle. She was taken to the same house
in Taman Seremban Jaya.
""The suspect then contacted the victim's family and demanded for RM150,000
ransom. However, the family could not pay.
""The victim was released unharmed, three days later, beside the North-South
Highway near the Nilai toll plaza before meeting a highway patrol officer for
assistance,"" he said.

"KIDNAP-FOR-RANSOM SUSPECT REMANDED
Court-kidnap
KUCHING, Dec 11 (Bernama) -- A kidnap-for-ransom suspect was ordered to
be remanded for four days by the Magistrate's court here today to
facilitate police investigation into the case.
The 43-year-suspect from Sibu, who gave himself up at the Sekama police
station here yesterday, was one of four people wanted in a nationwide
police manhunt in connection with at least three kidnapping cases in Sabah.
He and the others, believed to be gang members, were suspected of
demanding a ransom of S$10 million (RM20.7 million) from a supermarket
owner, Ang Kim Lin after abducting him from his house in Papar, Sabah on
Nov 20 this year.
Subordinate court registrar Mounsey Shundi, who sat in for the
magistrate, also approved an application by Chief Inspector Rosli Hamid for
the suspect to be handed over to the Sabah police to face criminal charges
there.
The suspect is being detained at the Sekama police station here pending
his transfer to Sabah.
In applying for the remand, Rosli told the court that on the night of
Nov 20 this year, the Papar Police Station had received a telephone call
from the victim's wife saying that her husband was kidnapped at 9.40am that
day in front of their house at Mile 1, Bukit Manggis in Papar.
In objecting to the remand period and transfer of the case to Sabah
police, the suspect's defence counsel Lim Liang Kee said that his client
was not in Sabah on that day.
He was on his way to Kuala Lumpur where he stayed at a Sri Petaling
hotel with another person and was only here two days later.
Meanwhile, Sarawak Police Commissioner Datuk Mohd Yusoff Jaafar said
the four gang members wanted by police were Lau King Chui, Teo Sing Huat
and brothers Tiong Mee Tiong and Tiong Mee Hock.
Another alleged gang member from Sarawak Tan Kok Han was shot dead by
Sabah police in Kota Kinabalu on Nov 29, nine days after the victim was
abducted.

"SABAH POLICE WANT TO QUESTION CAPTURED 'COMMANDER ROBOT'
Police-Abu Sayyaf
KOTA KINABALU, Dec 11 (Bernama) -- The Sabah police are making
arrangement to question the captured kidnap-for-ransom gang leader Galib
Andang, better known as Commander Robot, Sabah Police Commissioner Datuk
Pahlawan Ramli Yusuff said today.
The notorious Galib, who was believed to have masterminded the
hostage-taking incident involving nine Malaysians, 10 foreign tourists and
two Filipinos on Sipadan Island in April 2000, was captured by the
Philippine security forces on Jolo island on Monday.
Ramli said that the police were now preparing to question him
pertaining to Galib's involvement in the Sipadan incident and a similar
incident involving three Malaysians on Pandanan Island in September 2000.
""He was definitely involved in both the Sipadan and Pandanan incidents.
So we want to find out how he carried them out...that is why we will try to
get such information from him. Since we have already commenced
investigations into the incidents, if we were to close the case, we would
need to know how he gained entry, his preparations and things like that,""
he said.
Ramli said that Galib may also have information about the latest
hostage-taking incident involving four Indonesians and two Filipinos from
the Borneo Paradise Resort in Kunak on Oct 5.
Speaking to reporters after opening a seminar on crime prevention here,
Ramli said that the police would send out their questions to be posed to
Galib very soon.
Galib is being treated at the intensive care unit of a Philippine
military hospital in Manila for gunshot wounds on both legs.
All the Sipadan hostages were released in stages while the last, Roland
Ullah, a Filipino, managed to escape his captors in May this year.
The three Malaysians kidnapped from Pandanan were rescued in a military
operation after about a month of captivity.
Ramli declined to comment when suggested that Galib's capture would
mean that the threat of kidnapping in Sabah would be reduced.
""I would not want to make any speculations on that. However, the
security forces comprising the police and army are always prepared (to face
such threats),"" he said.
On the fate of the five remaining hostages taken from the Borneo
Paradise Resort, Ramli said that they were still alive.
""They are still being held by their captors...but on our part there has
not been any negotiation whatsoever and we will not entertain any demand,""
he said.

"JMTM CAN DECIDE ON ITS POSITION, SAYS KHALIL
Khalil-Kidnap
KUANTAN, April 13 (Bernama) -- The government will have no objection if
the Joint Media Team Malaysia (JMTM) want to leave Iraq following the
kidnapping of three JMTM members in Baghdad yesterday, Information Minister
Tan Sri Khalil Yaakob said today.
He said any decision to be taken by the government would be based on
feedback from JMTM members in Iraq.
""It is up to them; they should be able to advise us...,"" he told
reporters after opening the delegates meeting of the Kuantan Umno Division
here.
He said this when asked whether the government would withdraw the JMTM
team from Iraq, which has plunged into lawlessness following the toppling
of President Saddam Hussein by US-led forces.
Yesterday, two volunteers of the Malaysian Medical Relief Society
(Mercy) were injured while three JMTM members were kidnapped by
unidentified gunmen in an ambush in Baghdad.
The journalists -- New Straits Times photographer Haji Anuar Hashim,
RTM cameraman Omar Salleh and The Sun reporter Terence Fernandez -- have
since been released by their captors.
""I cannot make assumptions here because we see reports that journalists
wishing to enter from Jordan number around 2,000 because they can do good
coverage in that place (Iraq),"" Khalil said.
He said the 30-member JMTM was sent to Iraq to give Malaysians a better
perspective of the happenings in Iraq as many people felt that the western
media's coverage of the events was one-sided.
""That seemed to despise the Iraqis and the images shown were belittling
them,"" he said when asked on the portrayal of widespread looting and people
celebrating the fall of Saddam in Iraq.
Khalil said JMTM members had been gathering materials for their
write-ups and Malaysians would get a clearer picture of the situation when
they return.
""We appreciate their willingness to go there; of course, there are
risks and they are aware of the situation...this is dedication to their
profession and it's commendable,"" he said.
In his speech, Khalil said what was happening in Iraq should be a
reminder to Malaysians, especially the Malays, on the importance of unity
among the people.
He said Malaysia, which is also the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM)
chairman, would try to play an important role in post-war Iraq.

KEPALA BATAS, April 13 (Bernama) -- Two members of the Malaysian
Medical Relief Society (Mercy) were injured while three members of the
Joint Media Team Malaysia (JMTM) were kidnapped by unidentified gunmen in
Baghdad yesterday.
An Iraqi man acting as an interpreter for the Mercy workers was shot
dead in the incident.
Acting Prime Minister Datuk Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi told reporters
here today that Mercy president Datuk Dr Jemilah Mahmood and another
worker, Dr Baba Deani, were injured in the ambush by a group of gunmen.
The two were being treated at a hospital in Baghdad and reported to be
out of danger, he said.
The kidnapped journalists were New Straits Times photographer Haji
Anuar Hashim, RTM camera crew member Omar Salleh and The Sun reporter
Terence Fernandez, Abdullah told a media conference after opening the
Kepala Batas Umno Division annual general meeting at the Millennium Hall.
He said the Mercy team, led by Dr Jemilah, were then travelling in a
van from the Sheraton Hotel, where they were staying, to a hospital in the
city to help victims of the US-led invasion of Iraq.
The journalists were trailing them in a van to do coverage of the
relief work by Mercy volunteers.
The two Mercy workers were injured and their interpreter was killed
when the gunmen shot at them, he said.
Several other gunmen then kidnapped the Malaysian journalists.
Another Iraqi interpreter, who was working for the journalists, managed
to escape and inform the JMTM team at Sheraton Hotel of the incident.
Abdullah said it was learnt that the kidnapped journalists did not
suffer any injuries.
However, there has been no communication yet from the kidnappers, and
it is not known what they want.
Abdullah said the Malaysian authorities were doing all they could to
secure the release of the journalists.
Asked whether Malaysia would seek the help of the United States, he
said: ""We will do whatever is necessary to get their release.""
Abdullah said the situation in Baghdad was now very dangerous because
of the lawlessness there.
Mercy had informed the families of the victims while the Malaysian
secretariat in Amman, Jordan, had also told the journalists' employers of
the kidnapping, he said.
Abdullah said JMTM chief Datuk Ahmad A. Talib, who is in Amman, was
arranging help for the Malaysian journalists in Baghdad, but it was
difficult to send help because of the long journey from Amman to Baghdad.
He said the Malaysian embassy in Amman and also staff of the Malaysian
embassy in Baghdad, who are now in Amman, were trying to get in touch with
their contacts to help secure the release of the journalists.
The secretariat in Amman has been keeping in contact with the JMTM
group in Baghdad.
Asked if the government would withdraw the JMTM from Baghdad, he said
it was up to the secretariat to assess the situation and decide.
""They have to use their discretion because the situation there is
changing very fast,"" said Abdullah.
""They have a free hand to decide as they are there and know the
situation better,"" he said.
""If the situation gets too dangerous (in Baghdad), it would be better
to leave Baghdad,"" he said.
Abdullah said he had directed Ahmad Talib to constantly keep in touch
with the Malaysian embassy in Amman and Malaysian diplomats to Baghdad, who
are now in Amman, in efforts to secure the release of the journalists.
The Malaysian mission there was identifying parties that could help to
get the journalists freed, he said.
""We welcome any form of assistance in securing the release of the
Malaysian journalists. We cannot afford to be choosy,"" he said.
Asked on the chaos in Iraq, particularly in Baghdad, Abdullah said the
situation was proving to be more scary for Iraqis than the war itself.
The United States should take the initiative to restore law and order
in Iraq to ensure the people's safety, he said.

"GIRLS ESCAPE KIDNAP BID
Police-Kidnapping
KUCHING, Sept 14 (Bernama) -- Two schoolgirls escaped being kidnapped
when the car the perpertrators used to abduct them skidded and almost ended
up in a monsoon drain during a high-speed chase with police here last
night.
The girls, both aged 14, from Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Penrisen
here, alleged that they were forced into the car by two men while walking
along Jalan Kuching-Serian, near their home at 8 pm.
A police spokesman told Bernama that the kidnap attempt was foiled when
a patrol car ordered the Kancil used in the crime to stop while it was
passing Jalan Tun Abang Haji Openg on noticing it did not have any licence
plates.
However, he said the car sped off resulting in a high-speed chase with
police and the Kancil ending up skidding while taking a bend in Jalan Tun
Ahmad Zaidi Adruce.
""Three suspects got out of the car which nearly plunged into a
two-metre deep monsoon drain and fled on foot leaving the two girls
behind,"" he said.
The girls were then brought to the Sungai Maong police station here for
their statement to be taken before being brought home by their parents at
5.30 am today.
Police believe all three suspects were injured in the skidding incident
based on bloodstains found in the vehicle.
The owner of the Kancil had been identified and police expect to nail

"SALESMAN JAILED FIVE YEARS FOR KIDNAPPING BUSINESSMAN'S DAUGHTER FROM
COURT-KIDNAP
KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 15 (Bernama) -- A salesman escaped the hangman's noose after
he pleaded guilty in the High Court here today to an alternative charge of
abducting his former college mate in 2004.
Justice Lim Yee Lan sentenced Chan Wei Kheng, 27, to five years jail and
ordered him to serve his sentence from the day of his arrest on June
24, 2004.
She said that even though Chan had pleaded guilty at the earliest
opportunity offered by the prosecution, the court also had to take into
consideration the victim's family who would suff pain and
anguish for the rest of their lives.
She said the facts of the case clearly showed that Chan had masterminded
the abduction where he had betrayed the trust of a friend, Julia Lau @ Lau Lee
Mei, 22, who was found dead later.
Chan admitted abducting Lau with intent to secretly confine her behind
the Bukit Bintang new market, Jalan Kampong, at about 4pm on June 21, 2004.
He pleaded guilty to the charge under Section 365 of the Penal Code, if
convicted can be jail up to seven years.
Chan was originally charged with Yong Ming Kong, 38, and Yap Tiam Ek, 42,
with kidnapping and murder, both of which carry the death sentence.
Deputy public prosecutor Mohd Abazafree Mohd Abbas informed the court
that after taking into consideration the representation submitted by Chan's
counsel to the Attorney-General's office, the prosecution decided that the
salesman be given a discharge not amounting to acquittal for the murder charge
and that an alternative charge of abduction be preferred against him.
The court was told that Chan and two men had planned to abduct Lau, daughter
of a businessman from Sarawak.
Chan contacted Lau, who was attending a hair grooming seminar in Ampang, at
9.30am on June 21, 2004, and they agreed to meet in the evening.
After the seminar, they met and were joined by the two men before all of
them headed towards the city centre in a Proton Iswara car.
They stopped near the Bukit Bintang market and Chan left Lau in the car with
them before heading to Sungei Wang Plaza where he sold her handphone for RM150
and left for his hotel room in Jalan Petaling.
One of the men seated at the back seat of the car strangled Lau before
taking her to a vacant building in USJ, Subang Jaya. Both men later joined Chan
at his hotel room and informed him that the girl had died and her body had been
dumped in a mining pool.
At about 9pm on the same day one of them  contacted Lau's father in Sarawak
and demanded a ransom of RM1.2 million.
They called him again the following day informing him that the ransom had
been reduced to RM500,000 and told him to deliver the money at the KL
International Airport (KLIA) at about 11am that day.
They led Lau's father on a wild goose chase from the KLIA to KL Sentral and
Bukit Bintang and called off their plan when they suspected the presence of
police in the area.
Lau's body was found floating in a mining pool at about 9.55am on June 24,
2004.
Meanwhile, hearing against Yong and Yap was fixed for Sept 3.

"TWO KIDNAPPERS OF EX-MB's SON SENTENCED TO FIVE YEARS JAIL EACH
Court-Kidnap/BM
KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 15 (Bernama) -- The High Court here today sentenced
two men, who pleaded guilty to an alternative charge of kidnapping former
Selangor Menteri Besar Tan Sri Muhammad Haji Muhamad Taib's son to five
years jail each.
The court also fined the duo, R.Rajaratnam and K.Thiagu RM25,000 each
in default of six months imprisonment.
Rajaratnam, a labourer and Thiagu, a taxi driver, pleaded guilty to
kidnapping the 11 year-old boy from him home in Jalan SS7/2 Kelana Jaya and
holding him in unlawful custody at house number 17 in Jalan Cuepacs 4E,
Taman Cuepacs, Kajang.
They pleaded guilty to committing the offence at 7.30 am on Sept 29
last year together with five others who were shot dead by police.
Rajaratnam, 31, and Thiagu, 36, had earlier claimed trial to a charge
under Section 3 of the Kidnapping Act 1991 read together with Section 34 of
the Penal Code which carries the death sentence or life imprisonment and
whipping upon conviction.
They however changed their plea after the prosecution submitted an
alternative charge today, following which the court acquitted and
discharged them of the original charge.
The alternative charge is under Section 365 of the Penal Code which
carries maximum imprisonment of seven years and fine upon conviction.
Deputy Public Prosecutor Mohamad Hanafiah Zakaria told the court that
on Sept 29 last year, ASP Amidon Anan of Selangor police headquarters in
Shah Alam received a telephone call from Muhammad that his son was
kidnapped and that the kidnappers were demanding a RM6-million ransom.
Mohamad Hanafiah said police then mounted an operation code-named ""Ops
Scorpion"" to track down the boy and his kidnappers.
The boy was abducted on his way to school after a vehicle intercepted
and rammed into the car he was travelling in.
Hanafiah said three men emerged from the vehicle and approached the
driver of the boy's car after it stopped by the side of Jalan SS7/2 Kelana
Jaya.
At about the same time another car stopped in front of the boy's car.A
couple alighted from it and entered the boy's car, Mohamad Hanafiah said.
The couple forced the boy's driver to leave the spot in another car.
The DPP said the couple brought the boy to the road leading to Subang
airport before they switched car.
Mohamad Hanafiah said the boy was locked up in a room of a house in
Taman Cuepacs until Oct 2 last year.
The kidnappers released and sent him home on Oct 2 last year after
Muhammad paid the RM3 million ransom to a man at a location near the PJ
Hilton.
Mohamad Hanafiah said police then trailed the man to a house in Sungai
Besi here.
At about 8.10pm that day, a police team raided the house and in the
ensuing shoot-out,three men and two women were shot dead.
Police then found RM2,825,000 of the ransom money in the house and
returned them to Muhammad.
Rajaratnam was arrested on Oct 7 last year and Thiagu surrendered to
the police on Dec 6 last year.
Police investigations showed that Rajaratnam took care of the boy when
he was held captive at the house and Thiagu fed him.
It was also Thiagu who abducted the boy from the car at the time of the
kidnapping and who delivered the boy home to his family upon payment of the
ransom.
Investigations showed that the five killed in the shoot-out with police
were also involved in the kidnapping.
In mitigation, Karpal Singh for Rajaratnam, asked the court for a
lenient sentence saying that his client had repented and for the sentence
to run from the day of his arrest.
Gobind Singh Deo, counsel for Thiagu, told the court that his client
had regretted and apologised for his actions.
Mohamad Hanafiah however asked the court to impose a stiff sentence
saying that the offences committed by the two were serious and that the
boy's kidnapping was very well-planned.
The DPP argued that the boy was fortunate that his father could come up
with the ransom money, otherwise anything could have happened to him.
He said that to free his son Muhammad had to borrow RM2.7 million from
friends and forked out RM300,000 himself for the ransom.
In sentencing the duo, Judge Datuk Kang Hwee Gee ordered that their
imprisonment starts from the date of arrest.

"POLICE FOIL ATTEMPT TO KIDNAP TAN SRI AND FAMILY
Police-Kidnap
KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 16 (Bernama) -- Police foiled an attempt to kidnap a
tycoon with the title of Tan Sri and his family when they shot dead three
persons at KM35 Jalan Ulu Tiram, Johor, last night.
The three were believed to be the main planners in the kidnap group
which had committed at least five kidnappings in Johor since last month.
CID Director Datuk Salleh Mat Som told a news conference here that from
police investigations it was established that the Tan Sri and his family
members were in the group's kidnap plan list with the impending relocation
of its operations from JB to KL.
However he did not name the Tan Sri but said that the tycoon owned
several companies in Singapore and Hong Kong and headed many companies
listed in the KL Stock Exchange.
He said the kidnap gang was violent and dangerous.
Following the latest kidnapping incident, police formed a special team
with personnel from Bukit Aman Police Headquarters with assistance from
Singapore police to mount an operation codenamed ""Ops Scorpion.""
The operation was started to save a 13-year-old girl who was believed
to have been abducted by the same group of men on Feb 12 in Jalan Tasik
Bandar Sri Aman, Masai, Johor Baharu.
He said Singapore police was asked to help to ensure that the armed
kidnappers did not escape into the republic.
He said there was an exchange of fire between the group and police at
about 7pm when police managed to locate them as they were on their way to
Singapore after receiving the ransom for the release of the girl.
""Police knowing that the girl had been freed, followed the Proton
Iswara bearing false registration number WCT 4743 carrying the men and when
they reached KM35 Jalan Ulu Tiram, police directed them to stop.""
""The group ignored the order and straightaway opened fire at the
police,"" he said.
Salleh said the men who were found shot dead were Bong Chi Tak, 24, of
Jalan Rentaka 1, Taman Seri Tebrau, Johor Baharu, Chong Boon Keong, 33, of
Jalan Trus, Johor Baharu and Chong Han Chiang, 25, of Kangkar Pulai, also
of Johor Baharu.
Polis found an assortment of weapons and the ransom money in the car,
he said.
""One of the suspected kidnappers worked as a company executive officer.
They were always meticulous in their preparations.""
Salleh said the same group was involved in several cases of kidnapping
in Johor Baharu:
* On Jan 9 - at Taman Anggerik, Skudai. A large ransom was demanded
from the family of the man who had been kidnapped.
* On Jan 17 - involved the kidnapping of a girl in front of the Public
Bank, Wisma Diamond, Johor Baharu. A large ransom was demanded. After
several rounds of negotiations the girl was freed.
* On Feb 7 - in front of a house in Taman Molek, Johor Baharu. The
kidnap victims were a Chinese man, his 11-year-old daughter and
six-year-old son. A large ransom was demanded. They were also released
after serveral rounds of negotiations.
* On Feb 8 - at Yong Peng, Johor -- A 65-year-old man was abducted and
was later rescued.
* On Feb 12 - a 13-year-old schoolgirl was kidnapped in front of a
Chinese Temple in Jalan Tasik Bandar Sri Aman, Masai, Johor Baharu.
He said police were identifying several more members of the group and
believed they could be apprehended soon.
Salleh thanked the Singapore CID for its close cooperation in this
case.
He also said a special team had been set up to monitor kidnapping cases
nationwide.
People with information on kidnapping cases should report the matter to
police so that immediate action could be taken, he added.

dealer.

at the car park in front of the McDonald's restaurant, Awan Besar
rest-area, Kesas Highway, at about 11am on Sept 1, 2000.
They were jailed another seven years for wrongfully confining Ong at
house No.36, Jalan 2/3, Taman Bukit Permai, Kuala Lumpur between 11am and
7.30am the same day.
Meanwhile Chen Yen Cheong, 37, a computer wholesaler, was jailed five
years and seven years respectively for abetting them to abduct and to
confine Ong at the same places and times.
Justice Datuk Abdul Kadir Musa ordered the sentences to run
concurrently from the dates of their arrest. Chen was arrested on Sept 2
2000 and the other two the following day.
Abdul Kadir commended the police for their quick response to the report
besides rescuing the victim without any injuries and recovering the ransom
money of RM50,000 paid by Ong's brother to the abductors.
Earlier, deputy public prosecutor Shamsul Sulaiman asked the court to
impose the maximum sentence of seven years, saying that the three accused
were already given a discount by the prosecution when they were offerred
the alternative charges where initially, they faced the death sentence for
kidnapping.
The trio was charged on Sept 28, 2000 and the prosecution had called 12
witnesses before they changed their plea.
Shamsul said that even though Ong did not suffer any physical injuries
in the incident as contended by Chen's counsel Gooi Soon Seng, he had been
traumatised.
According to the facts of the case, Ong received a call from an
unidentified man on Sept 1 2000 offering to sell him three cars and both
agreed to meet at the Awan Besar rest area to inspect the cars before
negotiating the price.
Ong was inspecting a Proton car at the rest area when Yong and Leong
rushed out of the car and attacked him before bundling him into their
vehicle.
He was taken to a newly built house rented by Chen.
Later, the abductors contacted his elder brother and demanded a ransom
of RM1 million which was reduced to RM50,000.
Yong collected the cash left by Ong's elder brother at a toilet of
Putri Park Apartment, Taman Putra, without realising that he had been
trailed by a police team.
Chen was arrested an hour later by police who seized the ransom money
after they were told that the victim had been freed. The other two accused
were detained the following day.
Yong was represented by counsel V.Ravi and Leong by M. Stanilus

POLICE-KIDNAP
JOHOR BAHARU, Sept 16 (Bernama) -- A group of youths kidnapped a 16-year-old
schoolgirl, murdered the victim and torched the body in Kulai Jaya last Friday
night.
The kidnappers then demanded a RM33,000 ransom from Lai Ying Xin's family to
secure her 'release'!
The family paid the ransom -- unaware that the victim's decomposing body was
dumped at some undergrowth in Taman Putri.
It is understood that Lai's body was set ablaze to destroy any tell-tale sign
which might identify her killers who are known to the victim's family.
The police believe the teenager was murdered within 24 hours after she was
kidnapped in front of a supermarket where she was working part-time.
Johor police deputy chief Datuk Tun Hisan Tun Hamzah said acting on
information, a police team arrested a 16-year-old school dropout and two men in
a Perodua Kembara in Kulai at 6.15pm yesterday.
He said two-thirds of the ransom money was seized from the suspects.
Tun Hisan said about an hour later, another 16-year-old suspect was nabbed
to facilitate investigations into the kidnap-cum-murder.
Following interrogation of the four, the police were led to the undergrowth
in Taman Putri about 1.40am today, where Lai's charred remains were found.
While the police are waiting for post-mortem results to determine Lai's
cause of death, the suspects were remanded until Sept 21 to facilitate
investigations under Section 3 of the Kidnapping Act 1961 which carries a death
sentence, or life imprisonment and whipping upon conviction.
Describing it as a tragic case, Tun Hisan said despite the victim's family
paying the ransom money to the kidnappers about 3am yesterday, the girl was not
returned.
He said the family knew the identity of the kidnappers.
""The victim was a bright student...she scored distinctions in seven
subjects in the Penilaian Menengah Rendah examination last year.
Last Friday, Lai failed to return home by 9pm after her part-time job at a
supermarket.
About 6.20am the following day, her mother received a call from the

Acting on a report by the victim's family, the police formed a special task

"MOST KIDNAP-FOR-RANSOM CASES SOLVED, SAYS BAKRI
POLICE-KIDNAP
KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 16 (Bernama) -- Twelve out of 14 victims of kidnapping-
for-ransom cases reported in the first 10 months of this year were rescued and
returned safely to their families, Criminal Investigation Department director
Datuk Mohd Bakri Zinin said in a statement today.
He said two victims were, however, killed and the suspects in one of the
cases were arrested and charged in court.
""In another case, the suspects were killed in a shootout with police and
several firearms seized,"" he said, adding that more arrests and seizures of
firearms were expected before the year end.
Bakri said last year, 23 kidnapping and ransom cases were reported, with 22
victims rescued and returned home safely while one victim was killed.
He said police never approved or encouraged the payment of ransom to
ensure the release of victims as this would only encourage further kidnapping
attempts.
""In any kidnapping case, the utmost priority is to ensure the safe release
of the victim. So, in whatever circumstances, the decision to pay ransom rests
upon the families of the victims.""
He said police were risking their lives when confronting kidnappers who
were heavily armed and dangerous as the techniques used became highly
sophisticated and the kidnappers enterprising in their approaches.
""We have always placed kidnapping-for-ransom cases as our top priority.
""A specialised unit within the Criminal Investigation Department is
dedicated to pursuing all the kidnapping cases with the sole purpose of rescuing
the victims and arresting the kidnappers,"" he said.
Bakri said prosecuting kidnappers in court had also proven to be
challenging for the police as the investigation and prosecution process were
hampered because of uncooperative victims, family members and witnesses.
He said to avoid releasing kidnappers due to insufficient evidence, police
had to resort to using preventive laws to keep these criminals off the streets.
On Sept 12, a group of youths kidnapped a 16-year-old schoolgirl, Lai Ying
Xin, murdered the victim and torched the body in Kulai Jaya, Johor and then
demanded a RM33,000 ransom from the victim's family to secure her ""release"".

to an alternative charge of kidnapping a woman marble shop owner and for
holding RM84,950 in ransom money in 2003.

contractor Soh Kee Chai, 46, and hardware shop owner Ng Kim Leong, 46, to
serve the sentence from the day of their arrest on Dec 5, 2003.
For the second charge of holding the ransom money, Abu Samah sentenced
them to four-and-a-half years' jail. The jail terms are to run
concurrently.

with the intention of wrongfully confining her.
They committed the offence at a car park near the Wong's Diamond Marble
Shop in Jinjang at 8.30am on Dec 5, 2003.

were involved in the kidnapping and they had contacted Wong's husband to
demand for a RM100,000 ransom. Wong was freed after ransom was paid.
The kidnappers were detained when they were counting the money at the
restaurant.

kidnapping a 17-year-old youth for RM20,000 in ransom, were both sentenced
to jail for life by the High Court here today.
Judge Datuk Nik Hashim Nik Abdul Rahman said by pleading guilty, Goh
Kim Hoo, 37, and Lee Kok Loong, 25, had shown remorse for their act.
He ordered that the sentences commence from June 30, 1999, the day both
Goh, a welder, and Lee, a tile contractor, were arrested.
For the offence, the duo were liable to be sentenced to death or jailed
for life and whipping as well, upon conviction.
Nik Hashim said he will not order both men to be whipped.
Goh and Lee together with another man Goh Choong Ting, 52, were charged
with kidnapping a 17-year-old boy at a car park in Jalan Radin Tengah, Sri
Petaling here at 10.15pm on June 29, 1999.
They were charged under Section 3 of the Kidnapping Act 1961 (Act 365)
read together with Section 34 of the Penal Code.
The duo pleaded guilty after the prosecution closed its case in which
12 witnesses were presented and the court had also called the two to enter
their defence.
Nik Hashim said the life sentence imposed on Goh and Lee should serve
as a lesson to both men and to others.
""Whatever problem one may face, committing such an act is not a way to
overcome it,"" he said.
According to the facts of the case, the victim was kidnapped after he
went shopping at a night market in Sri Petaling and taken to Perak where he
was confined in a house.
DPP Jagjit Singh said after the abductors received the ransom, they
released the victim and gave him some money and a bus ticket to Kuala
Lumpur.
As Jagjit was presenting the facts of the case, defence counsel G.S.
Sidhu for Choong Ting (who maintained his not guilty plea) applied to the
court to disregard facts concerning the alleged role of his client in the
case as it could be prejudicial to Choong Ting.
The court allowed the application.
In mitigation, Goh, represented by M. Murukan, said at the time of the
incident he was unemployed and was facing a personal problem while Lee,

promised to turn over a new leaf.
Both men also told the court that they had no previous conviction and
by pleading guilty, they had saved the court time and costs.
Goh and Lee said the kidnap victim was not harmed and police had
recovered RM17,200 of the ransom money.
Jagjit urged the court to pass an appropriate sentence on Goh and Lee

However, the court considered the fact that the three had admitted to
the offence before the trial got underway and had cooperated with the
police, he said.
They admitted kidnapping R. Kirubaagaran at Simpang Jalan Raja Itam, in
front of Medan Selera, Jalan Besar, Tanjong Malim on May 15, 2001 at about

abducting and wrongfully confining a 12-year-old boy in Sipitang more than
four years ago.
Justice Datuk Sulong Matjeraie, in his judgment, rejected the guilty
plea as a mitigating factor after considering all the authorities and
submissions by the prosecution and defence.
He ordered the sentence to commence from the date of arrest. Both of
them were arrested on Aug 1, 2001 and on Aug 4, in the same year,
respectively.
Sulong said based on the evidence adduced in court, it was obvious that
the accused had made surveillance on the movements of the victim prior to
committing the offence.
The fact that the offence was committed so early in the morning at
6.15am and later asking for ransom showed that it was a pre-meditated plan,
he said.
Mark, 22, an odd-job worker and Tung, 28, a computer science graduate,
pleaded guilty on Jan 13 to an alternative charge of abducting and
wrongfully confining the victim under Section 365 of the Penal Code read
together with Section 34 of same code which carries a maximum jail term of
seven years and fine.
The other accused Matbidin Abdul Sani, 39, however, pleaded not guilty
to the alternative charge and claimed trial, on the same day.
All of them were originally charged with kidnapping the student, a son
of a doctor, and holding him for ransom for RM35,000, an offence punishable
under Section 3 of the Kidnapping Act 1961, which carries the death penalty
or life imprisonment, on conviction.
They allegedly committed the offence in front of the Regional
Polyclinic in Sipitang at about 6.15am on July 30, 2001, with another
accomplice only known as Ben, who is still at large.
Sulong said the act of blindfolding and tying up of the victim cannot

"SIPADAN KIDNAPPERS BACKED MISUARI'S REVOLT
Misuari-Manila
MANILA, Nov 20 (Bernama) - Most of those who led Monday's bloody
separatist war in Sulu belonged to a group blamed for last year's
kidnapping in Malaysia's Sipadan resort, officials said today.
Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) Chief Gen Diomedio Villanueva
made the remarks to belie reports that the attackers were former Muslim
rebels who had joined the military and the police.
He was referring to some 5,000 Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF)
rebels called ""integrees"", whom the AFP had re-trained and absorbed as part
of a peace deal with the Moro guerrillas in 1996.
Unconfirmed reports had earlier indicated that the ""integrees"" had
mutinied and joined disgraced MNLF leader Nur Misuari in reviving his
secession drive in Mindanao.
""They are all 100 per cent behind the AFP,"" Villanueva said, adding
that the attackers were mostly followers of the notorious kidnap-for-ransom
Abu Sayyaf group with which Misuari had forged an alliance.
Misuari, ousted by the 15-man MNLF central committee as chairman,
launched the revolt to protest next Monday's elections that would end his
term as Muslim Mindanao governor.
He claimed that the elections, to be held in predominantly Muslim areas
in Mindanao, breached the peace accord Manila sealed with Libya in 1976.
Citing intelligence reports, Villanueva said Misuari had forged ties
with Abu Sayyaf leaders, including Ghalib Andang, alias ""Commander Robot,""
to carry out Monday's attacks in Sulu.
AFP spokesman Brig Gen Edilberto Adan also said that all the 5,000 MNLF
integrees who now form part of the government's security forces had
remained ""intact and loyal.""
""There is no reason to accuse them of being disloyal,"" he said, adding
the ""integrees"" helped repulse Monday's attacks on several military
outposts in Sulu which left 59 people, most of them rebels, dead.

"EX-NEWSCASTER SHARMA KUMARI, HUSBAND WIN APPEAL AGAINST RM1.8 MLN DAMAGES ORDER
COURT-SHARMA
PUTRAJAYA, Nov 20 (Bernama) -- Former newscaster Sharma Kumari Oam Parkash
and her husband have won the appeal against the High Court decision ordering
them to pay RM1.8 million in damages to businessman Abdullah Sani Hashim.
In a 2-1 decision, the Court of Appeal panel comprising Datuk Gopal Sri
Ram,
Datuk James Foong and Datuk Suriyadi Halim Omar allowed the couple's appeal
with cost today.
Sharma Kumari and husband Pardeep Kumar Om were sued by Abdullah Sani who
claimed she had falsely and maliciously spoken defamatory words about him to two
policemen at the Bukit Bandaraya primary school area in Jalan Bangkung, Bangsar,
on Jan 5, 1998.
In the statement of claim, Abdullah Sani said Sharma Kumari had pointed at
him and said ""that man and his brother Datuk Abdullah Hishan Hashim tried to
kidnap my son"".
On March 2, 2000, High Court Judge Datuk R.K. Nathan ordered Sharma Kumari
to pay RM1 million and Pardeep Kumar RM800,000 in damages to Abdullah Sani, who
is the elder brother of Datuk Abdullah Hishan.
In his 30-page judgement, Nathan said both the defendants well and truely knew
that there was not an iota of truth in their allegation of an attempted
kidnapping and that their acts were to his mind raw and unexpurgated versions of
conspiracy.
On appeal, Sri Ram said the alleged slanderous words pleaded by Abdullah Sani
in his statement of claim did not contain any reference to him.
""In the present instance, the pleaded words are not capable being regarded
as making any reference to the plaintiff. It follows that a vital ingredient of
the tort is absent. On this simple ground, I would allow the husband's appeal,""
he said.
He also said the finding of conspiracy made by judge Nathan against the
appellants was unjust and therefore could not stand.
""The judge, by his decision, gave effect to an entirely new case which the
plaintiff had not made out in his own pleadings. The plaintiff's pleaded case
did not raise any charge of conspiracy. The judge therefore found for the
plaintiff on an unpleaded case, this is plainly wrong and manifestly unjust,"" he
said.
Meanwhile, Foong said the High Court judgement was not only bias against
the appellants but was also obsessed in wanting to return a verdict without due
consideration to the law.
""This view is fortified by the High Court's ruling that both appellants had
conspired to defame the respondent when this was not even pleaded in the
statement of claim,"" he said.
Suriyadi who gave a dissenting judgement, allowed Pardeep Kumar's appeal
but affirmed the High Court order of the liability and costs on Sharma
Kumari.
The couple was represented by counsel Lambert Rasa-Ratnam while Karpal
Singh acted for Abdullah Sani.

detained for allegedly posing as policemen, customs and immigration officers to
rob and hijack cars.

"KIDNAPPERS GUNNED DOWN AFTER SPENDING JUST RM100 OF RM130,000 RANSOM
POLICE-KIDNAP
JOHOR BAHARU, Oct 23 (Bernama) -- The adage that crime does not pay, rang true
for two armed kidnappers in Segamat early today.
Having collected a RM130,000 ransom yesterday, the duo released a 16-year-old
schoolboy whom they kidnapped near Chaah town in Segamat on Tuesday.
While the victim was safely reunited with his family, the kidnappers did not
live long enough to spend the ill-gotten gains, except for RM100 for food and
petrol.
Early today, the duo were gunned down by the police when they were engaged in a
shootout near Chaah.
In the incident about 1.50am, a special police task force tracked down the
kidnappers who were cruising in a Proton Wira, and ordered them to surrender.
Defying the order, one of the men fired three shots in the direction of the
policemen who returned fire, killing them on the spot.
Johor police chief DCP Datuk Mohd Mokhtar Mohd Shariff declined to disclose
the identities of the dead men, aged 35 and 38, as investigations were underway
to nab their accomplices.
He said that the police seized a .38mm revolver, three rounds of ammunition
and three parangs, believed to have been used by the duo in a spate of crimes,
including kidnapping and theft.
""We have begun investigations whether others were involved in the kidnapping
of the schoolboy whose family lodged a police report after he was released,"" he
said, adding that a special task force was set up to track down the kidnappers.
Mohd Mokhtar said the schoolboy was kidnapped last Tuesday in Segamat at
6.45am.
The police chief said that this brought to seven, the number of kidnapping
cases solved by the police this year, with the victims safely returned to their
families and the ransoms recovered.
He urged those with information on any crime to contact the police hotline
at 07-2212999 or the nearest police station.

"DEPUTY MINISTER, SENIOR POLITICIAN UNDER POLICE PROBE
Politicians-Probe (Exclusive)
KUALA LUMPUR, June 24 (Bernama) -- A deputy minister and a senior
politician-cum-tycoon in Sarawak are under police probe for alleged
involvement in gangsterism, illegal logging and attempted bribery of senior
police officers.
Both men, in their late 50s and 60s, hold the ""Datuk"" title.
Bernama learnt that a team from the Federal police headquarters in
Bukit Aman has been tasked with the investigation.
The tycoon, who is a branch leader of a State Barisan Nasional (BN)
component party, is suspected of having attempted to bribe policemen to
secure the release of an underworld ""don"" who is under police custody in
Sarawak.
The ""don"", known in the underworld as Le Long, is allegedly linked to
the kidnap of a business rival.
The 43-year-old man was detained when the police stormed his house at
Oya Road in Sibu about 3 am on Feb 27.
His arrest was the result of police investigation into the kidnapping,
over which six of his henchmen were nabbed three days earlier.
Initial investigation revealed that the six were linked to the kidnap
of one Kueh Chion Huat who was confined in a house between Feb 6 and 23.
The victim, who was also tortured during his captivity, was released
when his father reportedly paid a ransom of RM100,000, about RM20,000 less
than what was demanded by the kidnappers.
The ""don"", described by the Sarawak police as having links with the
Peninsular Malaysia-based ""Wah Kee"" secret society, is now held in the Sibu
prison, awaiting his kidnap case to be heard in the High Court.
Federal CID Director Datuk Christopher Wan Soo Kee, when asked to
comment on the alleged involvement of some Sarawak politicians in secret
societies, said: ""Our special team is looking into the matter and
conducting thorough investigations.
""This is a complicated matter, so we can't reveal much on this. We have
our own strategies and networks to handle the matter.""
Wan also said that ""Ops Cantas Kenyalang"", a special operation to
eradicate gangsterism in Sarawak, was ongoing.
""We want to ensure that Sarawak is free of gangsterism and we are
confident this operation would be a success,"" he said.
The police have crippled 17 secret societies active in Sarawak, with

"FALSE INFORMATION IN SHARMA'S CASE OF MOST SERIOUS NATURE, SAYS COURT
Court-Sharma
KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 25 (Bernama) -- The false information allegedly given
by former newscaster Sharma Kumari Oam Prakash to a police officer saying
that four men attempted to kidnap her son was of the most serious nature,
says a High Court judge.
Datuk Wahab Patail, in dismissing Sharma's appeal against her
conviction and three month's sentence, said the information given by Sharma
involves a possible death penalty.
Under the Kidnapping Act 1995, a person could be sentenced to death or
life imprisonment if convicted of kidnapping.
In his 48-page written judgment released today, Justice Wahab said the
fact that Sharma had lodged a report about an hour after the incident in
the school where she was alleged to have given the false information,
showed that she wished the matter to go much further.
He said the report lodged by Sharma, although in slightly different
terms, did not rule out kidnapping.
Yesterday, Justice Wahab dismissed Sharma's appeal to set aside the
conviction and three month's sentence imposed on her by the Magistrate's
Court for giving the said false report to a policeman.
Sharma, 38, was subsequently sent to the Kajang Prison after the same
court also rejected her application for a stay of execution pending appeal
at the Court of Appeal.
She was jailed three months by the Magistrate's Court on July 23, last
year after she was found guilty of falsely reporting to L/Kpl Zamri Isthnin
that four men had attempted to abduct her son.
Sharma, better known as Sharma Shukla, was alleged to have committed
the offence in front of Sekolah Kebangsaan Bukit Bandaraya in Jalan
Bangkung, Bangsar, here, on Jan 5, last year.
On the ground of appeal submitted by Sharma's counsel, Gurbachan Singh,
that the magistrate had erred in allowing evidence of bad character of
Sharma being admitted, Justice Wahab said the questions relating to matters
that were indecent or scandalous were clearly not intended simply to insult
or annoy.
Justice Wahab said the questions related to facts in issue or matters
necessary to be known and in which the court had the discretion to admit
into evidence.
He said the photographs of Sharma dancing closely with businessman
Datuk Abdullah Hishan Hashim and travelling together tendered by the
prosecution were relevant evidence and therefore admissible to disprove her
assertion that she was being harassed and intimidated by Abdullah Hishan.
""Such evidence was in effect made relevant by the appellant (Sharma)
when she made those assertions as a central part of her defence,"" he said.
Justice Wahab also gave his judgment on the ground of appeal given by
the defence that the magistrate erred in conducting the trial with unholy
haste and hurry and ordered repeatedly the case to proceed almost
continuously on dates which were never scheduled for the hearing
irrespective whether or not the defence counsel was engaged in superior
courts which had fixed hearing dates prior to this case.
He said granting or refusal of an adjournment was always a matter of
discretion and adjournments should not be granted simply to suit the
convenience of counsel, in particular counsel who wish to attend to some
other engagements.
""It is the business of counsel to manage his own affairs so that he
does not put himself under obligations to be in two different places at the
same time,"" he said.
He said although references were made by the defence that the counsel
had to appear in superior courts, there was no principle that a lower court
must vacate a hearing date.

"MANILA BASHING OVER MINDANAO AT KL MEETING
OIC-Philippines
By: Azman Ujang
KUALA LUMPUR, June 26 (Bernama) -- The Philippine government is
expected to come under fire for failing to fulfill its commitments to the
1996 Peace Agreement to end the armed conflict in Mindanao in southern
Philippines during a conference of foreign ministers of Islamic countries
beginning here tomorrow.
A conference official said today senior officials from member countries
of the Organisation of Islamic Conference (OIC) were drafting a resolution
that would criticise Manila for not keeping its side of the accord signed
with the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF).
"" The resolution will reflect the strong feelings of the OIC countries
that the continued failure of the Philippiine government to get economic
development started in the Mindanao region is prolonging the conflict by
Muslim separatist armed groups,"" the official told Bernama.
The sources cited the case of some 86 memoradums of understanding
(MoU's) for economic projects in Mindanao signed between various parties
and the Philippine government but none had so far got off the ground.
"" Because of the Philippine government's inability to get things
started, none of the projects has so far been implemented. This is a very
poor record of keeping promises,"" said the senior official of the MoU's
signed under the Brunei-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines East Asean Growth
Area (BIMP-EAGA).
Among the many projects proposed is a 5,000-hectare oil palm project by
Malaysia's Pilgrims Management and Fund Board (Tabung Haji).
But due to problems, especially indecision at the local level, only 500
hectares had so far been planted with oil palm while other projects
continued to stall, the official added.
Malaysia was also expected to voice its deep concern over the
continuing turmoil in southern Philippines given its proximity with Sabah
in East Malaysia which had been bearing the brunt of Filipino illegal
immigrants, he said.
Malaysia is home to over 280,000 Filipino immigrants who first fled
their country in early 1970's when the MNLF took up armed struggle for an
independent homeland in the predominantly Muslim region.
The MNLF laid down arms under the 1996 agreement which among other
things, provided for some 7,500 of its members to be integrated into the
Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the police.
The official said the four-day conference of foreign ministers was also
likely to condemn the kidnapping of 21 mostly foreign tourists from Sipadan
island off Sabah on April 23 by a southern Philippine armed group.
One of the hostages being held into their third month on Jolo island in
southern Philippines, Malaysian wildlife ranger Zulkarnain Hashim, was
released on Saturday and handed over to the Malaysian embassy in Manila
yesterday.
Abu Sayyaf, a group of about 200 young radical Muslims, many of them
reportedly trained in Libya and Afghanistan, has claimed responsibility for
the kidnap to press for a separate Islamic state in Mindanao.
But the senior official said the foreign ministers at their meeting
were expected to condemn the Abu Sayyaf, especially for carrying out the
kidnap ""in the name of Islam"".
"" If they (Abu Sayyaf) were to expect any sympathy from the OIC
ministers for their cause, they would not get it. Instead they will be told
in no uncertain terms that what they did is an embarrassment to Islam,"" the
official said.
The MNLF, which is given an OIC observer status, will attend the
conference in a big way, a 45-member delegation led by its veteran founder
Nur Misuari, the governor of the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao and a
signatory of the 1996 peace agreement.

"CREDIT ANALYST DENIES PERFORMING ORAL SEX WITH HIS KIDNAPPERS
Court-Kidnap
KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 26 (Bernama) -- A 51-year-old credit analyst denied
in the Sessions Court here today that he had performed oral sex with two of
the five foreigners charged with kidnapping and robbing him.
Chow Tim Kwong, a credit analyst at the Standard Chartered bank, also
denied the defence suggestion that he had paid the foreigners after he
performed oral sex with them five times in their seven meetings, at Chow's
house.
The suggestion was put to him by Datin Seri N.Saraswathy Devi, counsel
for Pakistanis Sikandar Ali, 28, Muhammad Asghar, 26, Raja Muhaamad Ishhaq
Ali Akhbar Khan, 28, Myanmar national Muhamad Amir Iskandar, 25 and Jagjeet
Singh s/o Bhupiender Singh, 24, of India.
They are alleged to have kidnapped and wrongfully confined him in a
flat in Jalan Selinsing, Taman Kok Lian, Jinjang, here, between Jan 29 and
Feb 4.
They are also alleged to have robbed him of RM600, several credit and
ATM cards, driving licence and watch at the same place on Jan 30.
If convicted, they can be jailed up to seven years and are liable to a
fine for the first offence while the second offences carries a maximum 20

them to his house. He also gave his handphone number to Muhammad Asghar.
He said Muhammad Asghar called him a few weeks later and they met in
Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman.
Several weeks after the meeting, Chow said, he received a call from
Jagjeet Singh who later took him to his house.
Cross-examined by Saraswathy, he denied having sexual encounter with
Jagjeet. ""I slept in my bedroom while Jagjeet Singh slept in the hall.""
Earlier in his testimony, Chow related to the court how he was
kidnapped after Muhammad Asghar had invited him to an apartment in Jinjang
after they discussed the sale of a carpet to Chow.
Examined by deputy public prosecutor Anuar Abdul Rahman, he said that
at the apartment there were four other persons including Jagjeet Singh.
They immediately kept him in a room with his mouth covered with a
masking tape. They took his wallet containing the money and various cards.
He said he was also beaten with a belt by Muhamad Amir during one of
the days he was detained.
Chow said he was rescued on the sixth day by a police party which also

"SECURITY MEASURES IN SABAH ADEQUATE, EFFECTIVE, SAYS CHOR
Chor-Security
PAPAR (Sabah), Oct 26 (Bernama) -- Measures taken by the security
forces to shield the Sabah coastline from pirates and kidnappers have been
effective since the kidnapping incidents in Sipadan and Pandanan islands,
Deputy Home Minister Datuk Chor Chee Heung said today.
""On the whole, the security arrangements are effective. I believe local
elements are involved in the Oct 5 kidnapping of six foreigners from a
resort this time,"" he told reporters when asked whether there was a need to
review security measures in Sabah following the abduction of six workers by
10 gunmen from a resort in Kunak, Lahad Datu.
Earlier, Chor, who is also a MCA Central Committee member, closed a
two-day workshop on management and leadership for Chinese non-governmental
organisations (NGOs) in Sabah and Labuan, here.
Chor said investigations revealed local elements had made it easier for
the kidnappers to escape with the three Filipino and three Indonesian
workers from the Borneo Paradise Eco-Farm Resort.
Asked whether the local elements were foreigners residing in Sabah, he
said it could also be locals.
As to the whereabouts of the kidnap victims, he said: ""We're not aware
where they are being kept but they should be within a few islands
surrounding Sabah.""
Asked whether they are still in Malaysia, he said: ""Hard to say. I
wouldn't want to commit because that is the latest detail.""
Chor said on Monday the kidnappers had demanded for RM10 million ransom
to release the foreigners.
The Oct 5 kidnapping in Kunak is the third in Sabah after two
kidnappings by members of the Abu Sayyaf group in April and September 2000
in Sipadan and Pandanan islands.

SHAH ALAM, Nov 26 (Bernama) -- Selangor police have busted a ""hit and
kidnap"" gang with the arrest of four people in a swoop on their hideouts
here and in Johor yesterday.
They also rescued their victim, an 18-year-old girl who was kidnapped
after the gang rammed into her car as she was driving home after work at
the Kesas Highway at about 10pm on Nov 20.
Selangor CID Chief SAC II Abu Bakar Mustafa said three days after the
kidnapping, a man contacted the victim's brother-in-law, a businessman,
through his mobile phone and demanded RM250,000 for her release.
""He was told to deposit at least RM100,000 in the victim's account
before noon, failing which they would decapitate her,"" he said at a news
conference here today.
Abu Bakar said the businessman however told the kidnappers that he
could only credit RM10,000 due to the short notice and RM2,000 of the money
was later found to have been withdrawn from a bank in Johor Baharu and
Melaka.
With the lead on the kidnappers, he said the police mounted ""Ops
Scorpion"" and raided a house in Taman Sri Muda, here at about 11.30am
yesterday where they detained two men, aged 22 and 27, and seized two ATM
cards belonging to the victim and RM1,300 of the money withdrawn from her
account.
In a follow-up operation four hours later, a team of 10 officers and 30
men raided a house in Taman Desa Rahmat, Tampoi, Johor, where they found
the victim confined in a room with another kidnapper, aged 21, he said.
Abu Bakar said the police also recovered two parang used in the
kidnapping while another kidnapper, aged 25, was nabbed 45 minutes later at
a house, not far away.
He said initial investigations revealed that the victim had been tied
up, blindfolded and kept inside the boot of a car for at least an hour as
the kidnappers move her from house to house.
The kidnappers, two of them burger sellers and with no criminal
records, reportedly had earlier wanted to rob the company where the victim
was working but at the last minute decided to kidnap her instead, he said.
He said the victim had been admitted to Tengku Ampuang Rahimah Hospital

On Jan 10, Peesa was accused of kidnapping the toddler from the legal

"ELITE FORCE AWAITS MISUARI'S DIRECTIVE TO DEAL WITH KIDNAPPERS
Sipadan-MNLF
KUALA LUMPUR, April 27 (Bernama) -- An elite squad of the Moro National
Liberation Front (MNLF) is expected to be deployed in collaboration with
the other Philippine security agencies to secure the release of the 21
hostages allegedly kidnapped by the Abu Sayyaf gang from Pulau Sipadan on
Sunday.
The Muhtalla National Force Command had on several occasions in the
recent past succeeded in obtaining the release of hostages after a series
of lengthy and sometime risky negotiations with their kidnap-for-ransom or
politically oriented captors.
The latest achievement of the unit was late last year when it secured
the release of a Mindanao-based Christian priest of Italian origin who was
kidnapped and held captive for several weeks in the city of Sioccon in the
province of Zamboanga del Norte.
A senior commander of the squad who spoke on condition of anonymity
said that his Zamboanga City-based unit was now awaiting further
instructions from the MNLF Chairman Prof Nur Misuari before making any
official contact with the kidnappers.
""Misuari is arriving in Zamboanga City from Manila this evening and
will immediately hold an emergency session with the commanders of the
various MNLF units, including the Muhtalla, to chart out our strategy (in
dealing with the kidnapping issue),"" he said when contacted by Bernama by
phone in Zamboanga.
Misuari who is also the Regional Governor of the Autonomous Region of
Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) had been mandated by President Joseph Estrada to
establish contact and negotiate with the kidnappers to ensure the captives
were released unharmed.
The captives, including 10 Malaysians, were abducted on the resort
island by a group of armed men in two boats on Sunday night and were
reportedly taken to a mountain hideout on the Sulu island.
The Muhtalla commander confirmed the Philippine intelligence report
that the captives were brought to Talipao, a hill village some 20km from
Jolo, the provincial capital of Sulu, one of the four provinces under
Misuari's autonomous administration.
""Our people on the ground reported that the kidnappers arrived in Jolo
with their captives on Tuesday night and immediately proceeded to the
hideout where the hostages were split into two groups and held in seperate
places within the vicinity,"" the commander said.
He also confirmed earlier reports that the kidnappers had demanded RM10
million in ransom for the release of the hostages. The demand was made
through a relative of a Filipino who was among the captives.
However, he was sceptical about a foreign wire report that the
kidnappers had already decided to release the 10 Malaysians, but could not
proceed with the move when the boat that was supposed to take and hand them
over to the authorities mulfunctioned.
""Until now I have not heard of such an initiative (by the
kidnappers)...probably it was just a strategic ploy on their part,"" he
said.
The Muhtalla commander said, if there was a need, Misuari might proceed
to Jolo by a fast craft tomorrow morning to personally assess the situation
and supervise the negotiation and rescue efforts.
As for his role, the commander said, in the past Misuari would pick him
personally to become the mediator between the chief negotiator (Misuari)
and the leader of the kidnap gang.
""For the sake of Islam, humanity and the brotherly ties between
Malaysia and the Philippines, I am willing to take the risk to meet and
talk things over with the kidnappers, irrespective of whether they are from
the Abu Sayyaf group or plain criminals,"" he said.
He refused to elaborate on the course of action if the negotiation
failed except to say that hostage taking was against the teachings of Islam
and should be condemned or even severely retaliated.

kept hidden within Tawi-Tawi Island in the southern Philippines.
State Police Chief Datuk Iliyas Ibrahim said the release of four other

asking for ransom.
The remaining hostages, employees of San Lim San Shipping Sdn Bhd based

Indonesian boat skipper J.E. Walter, 53.
""We don't know exactly the area (place of hiding) but we believe they

The four hostages are Indonesians Amir Nangi, 50, Arsyad Sagoni, 45,
and another person identified only as Suwito, 23, and Filipino Azarah
Sariban, 50.
They are among six hostages abducted by Filipino bandits who stormed
Borneo Paradise Resort on Oct 5, last year and believed to have been handed
over to the Abu Sayyaf group.
""Based on the information given by the freed four hostages, they have
not seen the other three hostages in their hideout,"" he said.
Asked whether the remaining hostages would be released soon, Iliyas
said he hoped so but ""it depends on the negotiations because apparently the
abductors have asked for more ransom"".
He said the gunmen responsible for the abduction could be a splinter
group of the Abu Sayyaf.

Anti-crime task force chief police Brig Gen Panfilo Lacson told a news

The group, operating since 1995, had collected 127 million pesos

This year alone, the syndicate netted 88 million pesos (RM$8.8

Lacson also said they are taking preventive steps to stop kidnappers
from posing as policemen when they carry out their criminal activities.
He noted that their investigation showed that the kidnappers had been
using police uniforms and carrying high-powered firearms to intimidate
victims.
One measure is the use of security tags among legitimate policemen to
distinguish them from the bogus cops, Lacson said.
""Only those of us inside the organisation should know. We should use

Court-Kidnap
KUCHING, March 29 (Bernama) -- The High Court here today dismissed the
prosecution's appeal against the inadequacy of sentence on two men who were
jailed six months each for kidnapping a 12-year-old girl.
Justice Datuk Ian Chin said he could find nothing to criticise the
magistrate's decision on Dec 9 last year to convict and sentence salesman
Derek Tan Kok Peng, 24, and Abdul Karim Zainal Abidin, 45, to six months'
jail each.
The duo, who would be completing their sentences on April 8, had
pleaded guilty to kidnapping Nelly Ting Su Hui, the daughter of Tan's
employer, from SRK Ong Tiang Swee, here, at 10am on Sept 16 1997.
The charge under section 363 of the Penal Code carries a maximum jail
term of seven years upon conviction.
Chin said magistrate Dean Wayne Daly knew that it was a serious offence
and he agreed with Daly that Tan was driven by a desire to help the
victim's father out of his indebtedness even though it was a misconceived
notion of what was right or wrong.
The victim's father, identified as Thomas Ting, had received a call
from Abdul Karim at about 11.15am that day demanding RM500,000 to have his
daughter released.
He said the magistrate was rightly moved by the fact that both
respondents, to their credit, had a change of heart in not continuing with
their plot and ensured that Nelly was returned to her father safely.
Deputy public prosecutor Marutin Pagan, in his appeal, submitted that
the court should take into account that they had kidnapped Nelly, demanded
RM500,000 and agreed to accept RM69,000 only after negotiation.
He said the lower court had also failed to consider the public interest
by not imposing a deterrent sentence on them.

He said: ""The mainstream front is not involved. I'm very sorry for

"" We are very grateful to the Malaysian people and government for
hosting at one time, millions of our citizens but you know politics had

As a negotiator in the earlier phase of the kidnapping crisis, Misuari
said, ""he had done his best to secure the release of the kidnap victims but
was somehow taken out of the negotiating process due to circumstances and
actions of others beyond his control.
To a question whether the Philippine government is deliberately
stalling the kidnapping crisis, he said,"" it is up to you (the press) to
interprete but don't create brinkmanship between me and the Philippine
government.""
Twenty-one people were abducted from the Malaysian dive resort of Pulau
Sipadan off Sabah on April 23. So far, one Malaysian hostage had been
released.
Misuari said his intelligence during the earlier phase of the
kidnapping episode was exact and the problem could have been solved there
and then but it was disturbed by the actions of certain officials and
agencies including the Philippine military.
He said collective punishment by linking the so-called Abu Sayyaf group
to the other Moro liberation groups by the West was not fair and was the
attribute of a primitive society.
Misuari also said funds allocated by the United Nations Development

"PVR AMONG TWO IN KIDNAP-CUM-MURDER OF SRI LANKAN
POLICE-KIDNAP
KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 29 (Bernama) -- A police volunteer reserve (PVR) and his
accomplice have been arrested in connection with the kidnapping of three Sri
Lankan nationals, one of whom was tortured to death while the ransom was
negotiated.
The PVR, attached to the Brickfields police headquarters, and the
accomplice,
were nabbed during a raid on a house at a workers quarters behind the Cempaka
flats in Pinggiran Batu Caves late last night.
Initial police investigations have revealed the PVR might have masterminded
the
kidnapping.
Gombak police deputy chief Superintendent Rosli Hassan said the murder
victim
was found naked and handcuffed inside a van in front of the house.
He said the deceased's compatriot who sustained broken legs, was also found
in
the vehicle.
The other Sri Lankan was found in the house with the two suspects at the
time
of the raid, he added.
""We do not rule out the possibility that the suspects were trying to dispose
off the body of the dead man before taking one of the remaining Sri Lankans to a
bank to withdraw an unspecified amount of money as ransom to secure their
release,"" said Rosli.
He said blood stains were found splattered on the floor in one of the rooms
of the house, adding that the police seized a car, handcuffs and mobile phones
belonging to the suspected kidnappers.
Rosli said initial investigations revealed the three Sri Lankans were picked
up by the suspects at an airport, three days ago, before being taken to a hotel.
""We believe the foreigners were tourists or job seekers...we are in the
midst of determining their identities,"" he said.
The suspects, aged 30 and 32, have been remanded for seven days to
facilitate investigations under Section 302 of the Penal Code for murder.
The body of the murder victim was sent to the Selayang Hospital. His
compatriots are undergoing treatment at the hospital.

"Police hunt 4 kidnappers
KUALA SELANGOR: Police are hot on the trail of four suspects who were part
of a group who received RM500,000 in ransom after kidnapping a pawnshop
employee here last week.
Senior police officials at Bukit Aman and Selangor declined comment, but
it is learnt that police are close to nabbing the suspects, described as
armed and dangerous.
Four of the gang members had kidnapped the victim, in his 40s, outside
the pawnshop in Taman Melawati, Kuala Selangor on Jan 25.
He was bundled into a Proton Iswara and shortly after, the kidnappers
contacted the victim's family with a ransom demand of RM1.5 million.
After negotiations, the ransom was reduced to RM500,000. The kidnappers
instructed the family to drop the money at an undisclosed location along
the North-South Expressway.
A source familiar with the case revealed that the drop-off proceeded
smoothly and the victim was later released unharmed last Wednesday at a
remote location in Pedas, Negri Sembilan.
After the victim had been released, the special police task force began
tracking the suspects' movements.
It is understood that after getting the ransom money, the gang broke up
and headed in separate directions.
The police team tracked down four suspects, between the ages of 30 and
40, to a house in Taman Malim Jaya, Malacca, last Thursday.
Most of the ransom money was also recovered.
Follow-up operations revealed that four other suspects had fled up north
and police began tracking their movements.
However, it is unclear whether further arrests have been made.
Checks on the background of the four men arrested revealed that they
were hardcore criminals who were also high on the police wanted list. Two
of them were wanted for murder and kidnap cases.
Of the other two suspects, one had spent time at the Simpang Renggam
detention centre in Johor, while the other had been banished under the
Restricted Residence Act.
The four suspects have been remanded to facilitate investigations for
kidnapping which carries the mandatory death sentence upon conviction.

"Report on kidnap group not true, say police

SHAH ALAM, Fri. - Police today denied a newspaper report of a syndicate in
the Klang Valley kidnapping schoolchildren for ransom and to remove
kidneys for the international market.
Shah Alam police chief Assistant Commissioner Mazlan Ariffin said today
investigations showed that there was no such syndicate.
The front-page story under the heading Penculik Idam Anak Tunggal
(Kidnappers target one-child families) in Harian Metro yesterday had
caused unwarranted anxiety and worry among parents of schoolchildren in
the district, he said.
He denied telling the newspaper's journalist that the syndicate, apart
from kidnapping children for ransom, also sold their kidneys and trained
them to become beggars.
He said the reporter contacted him about a schoolboy kicking a man on
his thigh when confronted outside a school here on Feb 20.
""I did confirm that police had received a report to that effect from the
boy's father,"" he told reporters at his office.
On Feb 20, Mohamad Radzuan Jamaluddin, 34, lodged a report at the
Section 11 police station saying that two men confronted his eight-year-
old son, Mohamad Hakim, outside the school compound about 12.30pm.
They asked him to accompany them into their car as the bus service in
the route was disrupted.
When he refused, one of the men grabbed his arm but the boy quickly
kicked him on the thigh before fleeing towards the bus stop.
The men then left the scene in the car.
Mazlan said policemen were immediately sent to the school, Sekolah
Kebangsaan Sekysen 24, the following morning but no pupils or teachers in
the school could confirm the incident.
""It's a good thing the father immediately lodged a report but it is
wrong to speculate without proper proof that a syndicate is out to kidnap

"Cops probe Sri Lankan for planning own kidnap
KUALA LUMPUR: Investigations into the kidnapping of three Sri Lankans last
week took a twist yesterday when it was learnt that police are probing one
of them for masterminding the plan.
A police source said one of the two victims who had survived the
three-day ordeal here had planned the kidnap of his two friends and
himself with the help of locals here.
One of the Sri Lankan victims, identified only as Samsudeen, 40, was
killed when he tried to escape by jumping out through an open window of a
double-storey shoplot in Pinggiran Batu Caves where they were being held.
Another is in police custody for investigations while the third is
warded with a broken leg at Selayang Hospital.
The police source said one of the two surviving Sri Lankans hatched the
plan to bring the two men here on the pretext of setting up a gems
business.
The suspect who is being probed had been in Malaysia for about eight
months. He had insisted that the two Sri Lankans bring samples of the
jewellery, which have since gone missing.
Police detained two locals to help in the investigations. One was a
police volunteer reserve and the other was said to be a dancer.
Investigations also revealed that Samsudeen and another victim were
forced to perform inhumane acts, including performing oral sex on each
other, which were recorded by the kidnappers.
Police now have the recordings.
Samsudeen's wife, Anasaithe, 31, who arrived here on Tuesday to claim
her husband's body, said the kidnappers had contacted her on Friday,
demanding the equivalent of RM140,000 as ransom.
""They threatened to kill my husband and send his body back to Sri
Lanka,"" she told the New Straits Times at the Kuala Lumpur Hospital
mortuary.
""The caller said they were policemen and that they had arrested my
husband and his friends for drug possession.""
Anasaithe said she received several calls from the kidnappers, who had
used the handphone of one of the other victims.
""I became suspicious when my husband was persuaded by his friend here to
bring the jewellery but I brushed it off as he had been here many times.
""My husband was a religious man who was close to his family.
""He took care of me and our 6-year-old son well,"" she said before
breaking down.
""I plan to stay here for a few days to find out what happened and who
the culprits are.""
Anasaithe was accompanied by relatives who claimed the body. They will
bury Samsudeen here.
Samsudeen and his friend, Sarifdeen Sahib Senu Mohideen, 36, arrived at
the Kuala Lumpur International Airport from Colombo on Thursday. They were
met at the airport by the suspect.
They hitched a ride with two locals in a van into the city where they
were taken to a shophouse in Pinggiran Batu Caves.
The victims were robbed of US$14,000 (RM45,000), gemstones worth
Rs600,000 (RM40,0000) and their passports. They were then stripped,
handcuffed and locked up in a room.
The other Sri Lankan was allegedly locked up in another room.
On Sunday morning, when one of the kidnappers was asleep, Samsudeen and
the suspect asked the other kidnapper if they could go to the toilet and
asked that the handcuffs be removed.
The two men decided to make their escape then. Samsudeen jumped out
through a window.
It is, however, not known how the suspect sustained the broken leg. At
the time of the escape attempt, Sarifdeen was locked up in a another room.

"Sri Lankan `kidnap' victim held for plan to trick mum
SUBANG JAYA: A mother's love knows no bounds as a woman travelled more
than 2,000km from Sri Lanka to save her son who had supposedly been
kidnapped here.
The mother, in her 50s, brought along RM50,000, the ransom demanded by
the kidnappers, for her son's release.
Her anxiety, however, turned to disappointment when she found out that
the ""kidnapping"" had been staged by her son.
A police source said the 23-year-old son had come to Malaysia with his
girlfriend six months ago. He apparently had plans to migrate to
Australia but ran into difficulties when his funds ran out.
""The man and his girlfriend came up with the idea of getting funds by
putting pressure on his mother.
""He got together with fellow compatriots in Kuala Lumpur and hatched
the kidnap plan.""
The group planned the ""kidnap"" with all the drama and flair required to
convince the mother that her son was in dire straits.
The first stage of the plan was to contact the mother in Sri Lanka with
the news of her son's ""kidnap"".
The caller threatened the woman that they would kill her son if she did
not come up with the ransom.
""The mother was contacted several times by the `kidnappers' and warned
not to inform the authorities or else her son would be killed.
""The woman raised the money by borrowing from several relatives,"" the
source said.
""The mother arrived in Kuala Lumpur on Saturday and lodged a report at
the Subang Jaya district police headquarters as she was worried about her
son's safety.
""A task force was formed to probe the case.""
The task force took 24 hours to track down the kidnappers. Several
raids were conducted in Puchong and Sentul where seven suspects,
including a woman from India, were arrested early yesterday.
All the suspects, aged between 20 and 30, have been remanded.
It is learnt that the mother is suffering severe mental distress after
learning that the mastermind of the scheme was her son.
She has been sent to hospital for counselling.

The shooting occurred at Taman Sungai Besi Indah, Sungai Besi, about 9pm
today, almost three hours after the ransom was paid for the release of the
boy.
Police have mounted a manhunt for another of the kidnappers who escaped

Police recovered the RM3 million, mostly in RM50 and RM1,000 bills, from
the house. They also recovered two pistols, a Llama and a Smith and
Wesson, two knives and several spent shells.
The identities of the five were withheld by the police pending further

"8 years' jail for youth's death
SHAH ALAM: Three Chinese nationals drew a ""well-thought"" plan to kidnap a
19-year-old student and ask for US$100,000 (RM330,000) in ransom.
They invited the victim, Tan Choo Mia, who was a friend, to a
double-storey house which they had specifically rented for the crime.
They wanted to confine him and call the victim's family for ransom.
But their plan went horribly wrong when one of them, known as Zheng Hua,
failed to control his temper and strangled Tan to death when Tan tried to
fight back.
Tan's body was stuffed into a dark blue suitcase and dumped along a road
in Damansara Jaya.
Zheng Hua flew back to China the next day, leaving his two accomplices
to take the rap.
Tan's body was discovered about a week later by a labourer.
Yesterday, Zheng Hua's accomplices - Liu Bing, 27, and Li Meng, 28 -
were sentenced by the High Court to eight years' jail and fined RM100,000
or a year's jail for two reduced charges of wrongfully confining Tan and
causing his death.
Judicial commissioner Siti Khadijah Sheikh Hassan Badjenid sentenced the
two, who were students of a private college here, after they pleaded
guilty.
Liu Bing and Li Meng admitted to confining the youth and to culpable
homicide not amounting to murder, with another still at large, of Tan at
house No. 3, Jalan SS2/105, Petaling Jaya, at 5.59pm on Sept 15, 2006.
They were initially charged with murder and kidnapping and had claimed
trial. They changed their pleas after the prosecution offered them the
reduced charges.
Siti Khadijah sentenced the two to six years' jail and RM100,000 fine
for confining Tan and eight years' jail for causing his death, the
sentences to run concurrently from the date of their arrest.
Liu Bing and Li Meng were arrested on Sept 20 and 24, 2006,
respectively.
Deputy public prosecutor Isa Hassim pressed for a deterrent sentence to
reflect the gravity of the offence.
He said public interest called for a heavy sentence to teach the accused
a lesson and to send a strong message to would-be offenders.
Counsel R. Thirukumaran and Tan Teck Yew, who represented Liu Bing and
Li Meng respectively, pleaded for leniency as their clients had regretted
their action.
They said the incident was planned and executed by Zheng Hua and the two
played a minimal role in the crime.

PETALING JAYA, Thurs. - A salesman charged with the kidnap of the 11-year-
old son of former Selangor Menteri Besar Tan Sri Muhammad Muhammad Taib
today told the magistrate's court that he was beaten by two policemen at
the Sungai Buluh Prison.
R. Rajaratnam, 29, whose case was mentioned today before magistrate
Rafidah Omar, alleged that a DSP Param and an Insp Prabha had visited him
at the prison and had slapped him and lifted a chair while shouting
obscenities.
""They told me that if I pleaded guilty, I would be imprisoned for two
years but hanged if I didn't.
""After two weeks, Insp Prabha and another unidentified policeman met me
again and asked for my wife's address and telephone number. They also
asked for my friends' telephone numbers,"" Rajaratnam said.
""They told me that DSP Param would make sure I served 20 years' jail and
that I would be sentenced to be hanged if I did not give the numbers,"" he
claimed.
Rajaratnam also claimed that all this happened at the prison's
management division.
He is represented by lawyers Karpal Singh and P.M. Mahalingam.
Rajaratnam is accused along with 12 others (of whom five were shot dead
and seven are still at large) of abducting Ahmady Karimy Muhammad at Jalan
SS7/2, Kelana Jaya.
He is alleged to have then wrongfully confined the boy for a RM3 million
ransom at his (Rajaratnam's) house at 17 Jalan Cuepacs 4E, Taman Cuepacs,
Cheras about 7.30am on Sept 29.
He is charged under section 3(1) of the Kidnapping Act 1961 and is
liable to death or life imprisonnment if convicted. No plea was recorded
today.
Rajaratnam was first charged on Oct 21 and no bail was granted.
Earlier, there was some confusion as to who was actually representing
Rajaratnam as the court had received two letters from Karpal and Gurbachan
Singh stating they would be representing him.
When asked by Rafidah, Rajaratnam told the court that he had not
retained Gurbachan as his counsel but had appointed Mahalingam.
Karpal, who arrived at the court at 10.20am, later clarified the matter
by saying both he and Mahalingam would be representing the accused.
Karpal told the court the police had no right to conduct an
investigation at the prison as that was under prison jurisdiction.
He applied that Rajaratnam be allowed to lodge a police report and if
the allegations were found to be true, asked that stern action be taken
against those involved.
Karpal also applied for the accused to be sent to a hospital for
examination.
Prosecuting officer Chief Inspector A. Narainasami told the court
Rajaratnam's complaint gave no details as to the date and time the beating
took place.
""The police can conduct an investigation with the permission of prison
officials and the prisons director. According to the charge, there are
still seven people still at large and investigation is still ongoing.
""I leave it to the court to decide,"" he said.
Narainasami also applied for a second mention date as he had not yet
received instructions from the deputy public prosecutor to transfer the
case to the High Court.
Rafidah ordered that the complaint be recorded and allowed Rajaratnam to
make a police report.
She set Jan 13 next year for mention.

"Man held over kidnap and rape of girl aged 15
Source:New Straits Times
SEREMBAN, Tues. - Police today detained a 41-year-old man in connection
with the kidnap and rape of a 15-year-old girl.
Police detained the man at a house here following a tip-off from the
public about 5pm yesterday.
Police also found the girl who had been missing since June 9.
Doctors at the Seremban Hospital confirmed that the girl had had sexual
intercourse.
The man, who is being detained under section 117 of the Penal Code, will
be charged for kidnapping and rape.
In Jempol, police are looking for a man who was alleged to have raped
his 14-year-old daughter.
Police said the man from Felda Palong 7 was alleged to have raped his
daughter on several occasions at their house since early this year.
Police said the girl did not lodge a report earlier for fear of being
harmed by her father.
It is learnt that the man had fled to Kuala Lumpur when he heard his
daughter had lodged a police report against him.
In Ipoh, a deaf woman and a 73-year-old grandmother were reported to
have been raped in separate incidents in the State.
The 30-year-old woman from Teluk Intan was said to be two months'
pregnant.
Hilir Perak police chief acting Assistant Commissioner Abang Abdul Wahap
Abang Julai said the woman told police that she was raped twice by ""a man
with a moustache"".
Police sent her to the Teluk Intan Hospital for an examination after a
report was lodged by her brother-in-law yesterday.
Perak Criminal Investigation Department deputy chief (administration)
Deputy Superintendent Chong Mun Phing said a 73-year-old woman in Taiping

"Wife tells of day she met the mistress
SHAH ALAM: Charges against a man who allegedly kidnapped and murdered his
7-year-old brother-in-law were dropped at the High Court yesterday
following the man's suicide in his cell.
Judge Datuk Syed Ahmad Helmy Syed Ahmad ordered that the two charges
against Kee Lian Kok, 30, be dropped after DPP Wan Shaharuddin Wan Ladin
submitted a copy of his death certificate to the court.
Kee hanged himself in his cell on May 18, exactly two years after the
boy, Ho Ping, was kidnapped. A note found near him requested that Ho
Ping's family forgive him for what he had done.
This leaves Kee's mistress and co-accused, Su Qiao-mei, a Chinese
national, to stand trial alone for the kidnap and murder of Ho Ping.
Su, 36, claimed trial yesterday to amended charges of kidnapping Ho
Ping at a house in Jalan SS19/4A, Subang Jaya, at 7.30pm on May 18, 2006,
and demanding RM500,000 ransom from the boy's father.
She was also charged with murdering the boy at a plantation in Changkat
Meranti in Kampung Baru Manjung, Perak, between 2am and 3am the next day.
During the hearing, Ho Ping's sister, Ho Woon Chen, 28, told the court
that she did not trust her husband after she found out about his affair
with Su.
Asked by Su's counsel Leslie Bala during cross-examination if she had
told Kee to fetch Ho Ping from school on the day of the kidnapping, Ho
said: ""I would never have done such a thing.""
Ho said she did not know why Kee had picked up Ho Ping from school that
day.
""My brother, Ho Kian Qiao usually picks him up. When we couldn't find
him, I informed my father that he was missing,"" she said.
She later told the court that her father, Ho San Cheah, knew about
Kee's affair with Su after Kee's parents informed him of it.
Leslie: When did you find out that Kee was having an affair with Su?
Ho: It was in 2005. Kee took me to Penang and introduced me to Su in a
terrace house in Jawi, Penang. My husband told me that his relationship
with Su was that of ""a husband and wife"". He then took me along with her
to a nightclub.
Leslie: Did you try to advise him to stop the relationship?
Ho: I tried to but he shouted at me. He even threatened to divorce me
and take our children away.
Leslie: Did you believe that he would carry out his threats?
Ho: Yes. That is why I eventually gave up asking him to stop seeing her
and began thinking about a divorce.
Leslie: Did you try to contact Su to tell her to stay away from your
husband?
Ho: No.
Leslie: You said earlier that your father did not trust your husband.
Is this because of the affair?
Ho: There were other reasons as well.
Under re-examination, when Wan Shaharudin asked her why her family did
not trust Kee, she said: ""He always borrowed money from me. Once he even
told me the money was to renew Su's visa. Even while he worked as a
cashier in my father's shop, there was always money missing.""
Hearing continues today.

KUALA LUMPUR, Thurs. - MIC president Datuk Seri S. Samy Vellu today called
for an investigation into separate police shoot-outs which left nine men
and two women, including an expectant mother in her advanced stage of
pregnancy, dead.
""We do not condone criminals .... But the death of an expectant mother
has raised sympathy among the Indian community.
""We have been besieged with calls from the Indian community and we feel
that police should justify their actions in these incidents.
""I brought the matter to the attention of Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr
Mahathir Mohamad, who is also Home Minister, during the weekly Cabinet
meeting yesterday,"" Samy Vellu said.
""The Prime Minister has given his assurance that an investigation would
be carried out,"" he said.
Over the past one week, 11 people whom police described as kidnappers
and gun-runners were killed in shoot-outs in Sungai Besi and Pengkalan
Chepa, Kelantan.
Last Friday, police stormed a house in Taman Sungei Besi Indah following
the release of an 11-year-old kidnap victim, son of former Selangor
Menteri Besar Tan Sri Muhammad Muhammad Taib.
The following day, six men travelling in a van were killed in a shoot-
out with police along the Pengkalan Chepa-Kota Baru main road.
Police seized a .38 Special long-barrelled revolver, a .65 calibre
automatic pistol, two home-made pistols, 30 rounds of ammunition and
several spent cartridges.
Commenting on both incidents, Samy Vellu, who is also Works Minister,
stressed that the party did not condone the activities of criminals.

"Man held over kidnapping
Source:New Straits Times
GEORGE TOWN, Sun. - A 47-year-old man was arrested here last night to
help in investigations into the kidnapping of an eight-year- old son of a
Datuk in Shah Alam.
The boy, kidnapped on March 11, was released 20 days later in Jawi,
Nibong Tebal, after his family had paid a RM840,000 ransom.
The suspect was picked up by officers from Bukit Aman's Serious Crimes
Division and Penang police.
Sources said police had arrested three men in Kuala Lumpur shortly
after the boy's kidnap but released them later.
They got their break when they detained a 40-year-old man in Kuala
Lumpur last Wednesday. This led them to the suspect in Weld Quay at
8.30pm yesterday.
According to the sources, the boy, the younger of two sons, was moved
to several States by his kidnappers to evade the police.
He was kidnapped from his house in Taman Tadisma in Section 13, Shah
Alam.
The boy's father, believed to be a former Selangor palace official, is
now in the real estate business.
It is learnt that two men entered the Datuk's double- storey link house
by claiming to be promoters of a direct-selling company.
Apart from the boy and his mother, his 18-year-old brother was also at
home.
Once they got inside the house, the suspects whipped out knives and
threatened the boy's mother and brother.
The men then dragged the boy into a car, believed to be a Proton Iswara
driven by an accomplice, and fled.

"Cabbie charged with kidnap of former MB's son
Source:New Straits Times
PETALING JAYA, Thurs. - A taxi driver was charged in the magistrate's
court today with the kidnap of the 12-year-old son of former Selangor
Menteri Besar Tan Sri Muhammad Muhammad Taib.
K. Thiagu, of Taman Sentosa, Klang, is accused along with five others
who were shot dead on Sept 29 last year, of wrongfully restraining Ahmady
Karimy Muhammad, then 11, at Jalan SS 7/2, Kelana Jaya.
He is alleged to have thereafter wrongfully confined the boy for a RM3
million ransom at a house at 17 Jalan Cuepacs 4E, Taman Cuepacs, Cheras,
about 7.30am on Sept 29 last year.
Thiagu, who was unrepresented, was arrested on Dec 16 last year. No plea
was recorded and magistrate Laila Majenun Ali transferred his case to the
Shah Alam High Court.
Laila also transferred to the Shah Alam High Court another case of a
cable salesman charged on Oct 21 last year with abducting Ahmady Karimy at
the same place and time.
R. Rajaratnam, 30, was accused along with 12 others (of whom five were
shot dead and seven are still at large) of abducting the boy at Jalan SS
7/2, Kelana Jaya, and thereafter wrongfully confining him for a RM3
million ransom at his (Rajaratman's) house at 17 Jalan Cuepacs 4E, at the
same time and date. He was arrested on Oct 7 last year.
Both Thiagu and Rajaratnam were charged under section 3 of the
Kidnapping Act 1961 which is punishable by death or life imprisonment if
convicted.
Lawyer Gobind Singh Deo, for Rajaratnam, later made an application to
the court to throw out Rajaratnam's charge because it had been rendered
defective.
""Both charges conflict with each other because the charge against Thiagu
makes him out to be the person who allegedly committed the offence as the
words `... along with five others who were shot dead... appeared',"" Gobind
said.
""Thus, if Thiagu, without anyone else, had allegedly committed the
offence, then my client did not commit kidnap,"" he said.
Gobind also said that Rajaratnam's charge reads ""... along with 12
others (of whom five were shot dead and seven are still at large) ...""
which connotes that there were other persons involved in the commission of
the offence.
Prosecuting officer Chief Inspector Thong Seng Kong then told the court
that it was too early to determine whether the charges were defective
before evidence was taken, and applied for the charge against Rajaratnam
not to be dismissed.
He also said that he had received a consent letter from the Deputy
Public Prosecutor to prosecute both cases.
Gobind argued that the letter only referred to an offence of abducting
or kidnap and not as stated in Thiagu's charge.
However, Thong said: ""... The definition of abducting includes restraint
and the reason the words used in both charges were different was to show
the role of both the accused.""
Laila ruled that the court would not make a decision on the applications
put forth as this was under the jurisdiction of the High Court.
A trial date for the cases would be fixed by the said court at a later

"Father-daughter ties affected, court told
Source:New Straits Times
KUALA LUMPUR, Tues. - A businessman told the High Court today that his
relationship with his youngest daughter was affected as a result of a
complaint made to the police by former RTM newsreader Sharma Kumari Shukla
and her husband that he had kidnapped their son.
Businessman Abdullah Sani Hashim said Sharma had told two policemen
while pointing at him ""that man and his brother Datuk Abdullah Hishan Mohd
Hashim tried to kidnap my son"", about 8.20am around the Bukit Bandaraya
primary school area in Jalan Bangkung, Bangsar, on Jan 5, 1998.
Abdullah Sani, 55, said after the incident, his daughter (who was in
Standard Six at the time) came home in tears because her friends had
teased her and accused him (Abdullah Sani) of being a kidnapper.
Abdullah Sani said the bond and close relationship between him and his
daughter began to ""crack"" as his daughter became quiet and distanced
herself from him.
Testifying in a RM10 million defamation suit he brought against Sharma
and her husband, Pardeep Kumar s/o Om Parkash Sharma, Abdullah Sani, who
is the brother of Hishan, is claiming that Sharma had falsely and
maliciously spoken the defamatory words about him to the policemen.
Replying to questions by his lawyer, M. Manoharan, Abdullah Sani said he
himself was humiliated every time he sent or fetched his daughter from
school as the other parents would shield their children from him as though
he was a kidnapper.
Abdullah Sani said he was in the school compound at the time waiting to
see the headmaster to discuss his daughter's class placement when he saw
Sharma and Pardeep saying something to the policemen.
Abdullah Sani said one of the policemen approached him and asked for his
identification card. When he asked why, the policeman pointed towards
Sharma and said she had made a complaint and lodged a police report that
he and Hishan were suspected of trying to kidnap her son.
""I was shocked and humiliated by the accusation ... I have never
kidnapped anyone ... I myself have three children and I am a responsible
father ...""
Abdullah Sani said he felt extremely humiliated because there were many
parents and guardians in the vicinity. He said his health suffered as a
result of the incident.
Abdullah Sani, who is a retired customs officer, said that when he began
to help another brother to sell traditional medicine, he again felt
humiliated when some customers, who were parents of pupils in the school,
brought up the subject and mocked him about the kidnapping accusation.
When suggested by Sharma's lawyer, Lambert Rasaratnam, that he had no
reason to hang around the school compound that day, Abdullah Sani replied
that his presence at the school was to settle his daughter's class
placement as well as to take care of her school fees, books and to get to
know her teachers.
When suggested that it was not humiliating for a policeman to ask for
one's identity card, Abdullah Sani said the circumstances and the fact
that it was in a public place caused him extreme embarrassment.
Sharma, in her statement of defence, said Abdullah Sani had suffered no
actual damage and this was an attempt to harass, embarrass and oppress her
and Pardeep.
M. Kalaichelvan assisted Manoharan. Hearing continues before judge Datuk

"Maid escapes kidnap charge
Source:New Straits Times
KUALA LUMPUR: It was not a kidnapping. It was a simple case of getting
lost.
And with that, a 35-year-old Indonesian maid escaped serious charges
after going missing for three hours with her employer's child last week.
Brickfields police chief Assistant Commissioner Mohd Dzuraidi Ibrahim
said the deputy public prosecutor was satisfied with the investigation
and decided not to charge the maid.
""Based on our investigations, the maid had no intention to kidnap the
child,"" Dzuraidi said. ""She will be released to her agency tomorrow. They
will then decide what to do with her.""
The maid, from Java, caused a stir last week when she left her
employer's apartment in Taman Abadi Indah, Jalan Klang Lama, with the
employer's three-year-old daughter.
The disappearance of the two sparked a city-wide search involving
hundreds of radio taxi drivers.
Less than three hours later, the maid and the toddler were found
standing by the roadside near the Desa Water Park by a taxi driver.
Later at the Brickfields police station, the maid told police that she
had taken the toddler out for a walk and could not find her way back.
Her employer, Foong Sook Thin, a beauty parlour operator, believed the
maid's story and urged police not to take action against her.
She told police that the maid had been working with them for the past
one month and had proven to be trustworthy.
Foong also told police that nothing was missing from the apartment when
the maid disappeared with the toddler.

"Remarks of ex-newsreader read in court
Source:New Straits Times
KUALA LUMPUR, Wed. - Apart from being accused by former RTM newsreader
Sharma Kumari Shukla and her husband of being a kidnapper, businessman
Abdullah Sani Hashim was also referred to as ""...a brainless puppet..."",
the High Court heard today.
Judge Datuk R.K. Nathan read this from a statement made by Sharma on Feb
16, 1998, after Abdullah Sani's lawyer, M. Kalaichelvan, drew his
attention to it in a bundle of documents agreed upon by both parties.
Nathan then allowed an application by Kalaichelvan to ask Abdullah Sani
an additional question at the re-examination stage after Kalaichelvan said
he was seeking to show Sharma's malicious intent.
Abdullah Sani, 55, was testifying in his RM10 million defamation suit
against Sharma and her husband, Pardeep Kumar s/o Om Parkash Sharma for
speaking defamatory words about him to two policemen about 8.20am in the
Bukit Bandaraya primary school area, Jalan Bangkung, Bangsar, on Jan 5,
1998.
The statement Nathan read said: ""...Abdullah Sani is nothing but a
brainless puppet used by his brother for all the deceits and dirty
work...Abdullah Sani is working for his brother and is indebted to
him...It is only when I met the cops that I told them that I fear that he
might harm my son and do not rule out kidnapping on that day but at
anytime...""
In dismissing an objection by Sharma's lawyer Lambert Rasaratnam who
argued it (the statement) was irrelevant, Nathan said:
""...You see the foolhardiness of putting in documents without making
objections...Both parties by consent had agreed to admit these
documents...Sharma had accused Abdullah Sani of being a kidnapper on Jan
5, 1998, had later lodged a police report saying he was trying to kidnap
her son and then gave a statement that he is a brainless puppet used by
his brother...You say it's not relevant?""
When cross-examined by Lambert, Abdullah Sani disagreed that the word
""he"" in the statement did not refer to him.
In his statement of claim, Abdullah Sani said Sharma had told two
policemen, while pointing at him saying: ""That man and his brother Datuk
Abdullah Hishan Mohd Hashim tried to kidnap my son.""
Earlier, when suggested by Lambert during cross-examination that he
(Abdullah Sani) refused to show his identity card to one of the policemen
who approached him in the school compound, Abdullah Sani said he did not
refuse but had first asked why the policeman wanted to see it.
He had said the policeman had pointed towards Sharma and said: ""That
woman has made a complaint that your brother, Datuk Abdullah Hishan Mohd
Hashim and you are suspected of trying to kidnap her child.""
However, he agreed that apart from what the policeman told him (about
Sharma's complaint), he did not know what was actually said by Sharma to
the policeman.
Sharma, in her statement of defence, said Abdullah Sani had suffered no
actual damage and this was an attempt to harass, embarrass and oppress her
and Pardeep.
Hearing before Nathan continues.
In another matter, Sharma's application for a Senior Assistant Registrar
to review a bankruptcy order made against her was dismissed with costs.
Sharma was declared a bankrupt on Jan 28 by Senior Assistant Registrar
S. Kalyana Kumar following her failure to pay Hishan RM1,179,726.05 which
Nathan had ordered in his judgment on Sept 30 last year.
Hishan had sued Sharma over money he allegedly lent her to buy Insas Bhd

"Police believe arrested trio linked to kidnappings
Source:New Straits Times
SHAH ALAM, Fri. - Police believe the three men arrested shortly after they
had collected RM70,000 ransom for the release of a kidnap victim yesterday
could be responsible for a similar case on Oct 2.
In both cases, the victims had been lured out from their homes on the
pretext of discussing the rental of a house.
Selangor police chief Datuk Kamaruddin Hamzah said the kidnappers had
kept the victims in the same undergrowth near Rawang while negotiating the
ransom with the victims' family.
Yesterday, police arrested three men shortly after they collected a
RM70,000 ransom from the family of their 70-year-old kidnap victim in
Kuala Lumpur.
The three are a 44-year-old self-employed man from Desa Jaya in Kepong,
a labourer aged 34 from Taman Indah in Seremban, and an unemployed, 27,
from Jerantut.
Following the arrest, police recovered an immitation Smith & Wesson
revolver from an apartment rented by one of men at the Mawar Dahlia
Condominium in Rawang.
Kamaruddin said all three were also believed to be involved in the
kidnap of a 65-year-old man in Puchong who was released after the RM60,000
ransom was paid.
In yesterday's case, Kamaruddin said the three were arrested by a police
team after a chase in Serendah about 4pm - about 3 1/2 hours after
releasing the victim, a former tin-miner.
""Two of them were arrested in a Proton Wira near the Gedung Ria
Supermarket in Country Homes, Rawang, while the other was picked up in the
supermarket,"" he told reporters at the State police headquarters.
The victim was kidnapped about 1pm on Tuesday after he was duped into
meeting the kidnappers to discuss about renting his house in Subang
Permai.
The three men abducted the victim when he showed up at the vacant house
and demanded a RM200,000 ransom, which was later reduced to RM70,000.
He was held in an undergrowth for two days and was released about 3.45pm
yesterday after the ransom was paid.
Kamaruddin said the kidnappers were not armed when they were arrested,
adding that police recovered the RM70,000 ransom, another RM2,000 and four
handphones.
""They will be charged under Section 3(1) of the Kidnapping Act, 1961,
which carries a death sentence or life imprisonment and whipping upon
conviction.
""We have sufficient evidence to link the three to the kidnap case in
Puchong on Oct 2,"" he said.
Kamaruddin added that the victim was similarly lured to a vacant house
which was advertised for rent and held in the same undergrowth near
Rawang.
The three had wanted a RM100,000 ransom but several days later, released
the man after collecting RM60,000.
The three men were later produced at the Petaling Jaya Magistrates'
Court where police obtained a nine-day remand order to facilitate
investigations.

"Strangled with bare hands
KULAI: Lai Ying Xin was strangled within 24 hours of her abduction, the
post-mortem revealed.
The killer had used his bare hands to strangle the 16-year-old.
And after she was dead, the kidnappers contacted her family to demand a
ransom ""for her release"".
State police chief Datuk Mokhtar Shariff said the cause of death was
manual strangulation.
He, however, did not reveal whether police had identified the killer
among the four suspects currently in custody.
The four, aged between 16 and 22, were nabbed in connection with the
kidnapping and murder of Ying Xin.
The teenager, a student of Sekolah Menengah Sultan Ibrahim Kulai, also
worked part-time in a hypermarket.
She was grabbed by the kidnappers last Thursday night while on her way
home.
Mokhtar visited Ying Xin's family at their house in Taman Gunung Pulai
here yesterday to extend his condolences and those of Inspector-General
of Police Tan Sri Musa Hassan.
He gave an assurance to the family that police would expedite
investigations.
""We are waiting for the report from the Chemistry Department and the
outcome of the DNA test. Once we have them, we can hand the investigation
papers to the deputy public prosecutors.""
Mokhtar said Ying Xin's remains, now at the Sultanah Aminah Hospital
mortuary, could only be released to her family after the investigations
were completed.
""We want to charge the suspects as soon as possible,"" he said, adding
that he was shocked that two 16-year-old boys were among the suspects.
Mohktar said police had not ruled out the possibility that the
kidnap-cum-murder case was a crime of passion.
The four suspects, who have been remanded until Sept 21, include a
22-year-old hairstylist who was said to have been infatuated with Ying
Xin despite her rejecting his advances.
The four were arrested on Monday. They later led police to the body
which had been dumped at a clearing in Taman Putri here, before being set
ablaze.
Police also found part of the ransom money on the suspects. Although
the suspects had demanded a ransom of RM60,000, the sum was reduced to
RM35,000 after negotiations.

The four Indonesians - Nur Cholis Ackwan, 34, Sarman Ridzuan, 45,
Riiyardi Sarkam, 35, and Jumini Jumanti, 35, from West Java - yesterday
pleaded guilty to kidnapping Pakistani Mehmood Wasis.
The offence was committed in Jalan Mawar in Taman Bukit Serdang, Seri
Kembangan, on July 20, 2006.
The mastermind behind the botched kidnapping and another accomplice,
however, are still at large.
According to facts, Jumini followed Mehmood as they walked down the
road before Nur Cholis and two others approached the Pakistani.
They claimed they were policemen and demanded to see his passport.
When Mehmood refused, Nur Cholis hit him on the head and pushed him
into a Proton Wira, taking him to an unnumbered house in Klang, where
Sarman and Riiyardi waited.
They then contacted Mehmood's friend, Shahbaz Alam, and demanded a
ransom of RM20,000. But after negotiations, they agreed on RM4,000.
Shahbaz, however, contacted police and an ambush was set.
Police officer ASP Zainal Abdullah posed as a taxi driver who drove
Shahbaz to the meeting spot which was at a petrol station in Meru, Klang.
When Shahbaz handed the envelope containing the cash to Nur Cholis, a
police team nabbed him on the spot.
They also arrested three others who were in a car with Mehmood, who was
rescued unhurt.
Counsel V. Aravindakshan told the court that the four were merely used
by the mastermind, whom he identified as Kasmadi, who is still at large.
He said they regretted their actions and pointed out that they did not
get the chance to spend the ransom.
He said Jumini, a single mother, was also roped in without her
knowledge and needed to return to Indonesia where she has a 15-year-old
daughter.
Deputy public prosecutor Samihah Rhazali said the four were adults and
could have chosen not to participate in the kidnapping. She also said
such cases were becoming rampant.
High Court judge Datuk Zaharah Ibrahim ordered their sentences to run
from the date of their arrests on July 21, 2006.

"Kidnappers gave family the runaround
Source:New Straits Times
BATU PAHAT, Wed. - The family of kidnap victim Tan Chui Bok, who
apparently died of a heart attack while being held captive, was given the
runaround by his abductors before police found Tan's decomposed body in a
oil palm estate in Batu Pahat on Monday.
A police source said the  businessman's eldest son was the kidnappers'
main ""contact man"".
""They contacted Tan's eldest son for the ransom. He was initially asked
to go to Yong Peng to hand over the cash. But when he reached there, they
called him on his mobile phone and ordered him to go to Segamat instead,""
a source said.
""From Segamat, he was later told to go to Air Hitam, where he waited for
two days for further instructions. But the kidnappers did not turn up and
he lost touch with them.""
The son, who was alerted by police on the discovery of the body, was
later asked to identify it as that of his father.
""Tan was dressed in black trousers and a white short-sleeved shirt.
There were bruises on his hands and legs, possibly because his limbs were
bound throughout the time he was held captive by the abductors,"" added the
source.
Police have to date arrested three suspects in Batu Pahat in connection
with the kidnapping. A hunt is under way for several other suspects.
Johor Gerakan treasurer Tan Yee Yee, who is Tan's nephew, said his
uncle's funeral would be held at his home in Taman Peserai in Batu Pahat
on Saturday.
The 79-year-old victim, a prominent figure in Batu Pahat, was kidnapped
while visiting his estate in Seri Sulong 45 days ago.
A villager had found the victim's car abandoned at the estate and the
family immediately suspected something wrong as his spectacles were found
on the floor of the car.
It is learnt that kidnappers demanded a ransom of RM1.5 million. But
their plan failed when the millionaire suffered a heart attack and died.
The abductors then arranged a ""private funeral"" in an oil palm estate.

"Nigerian kidnap ring busted with arrest of 6
SHAH ALAM: Police arrested four Nigerians for running a kidnapping
syndicate after they released a fellow countryman, believed to be the son
of a politician, who was held captive for almost a month.
The 28-year-old victim, a LimKokWing University of Creative Technology
student, who is graduating next month, was kidnapped on May 23 when he was
standing at a roadside in Cyberjaya about 8.30pm.
Acting Selangor CID chief Assistant Commissioner Omar Mammah said the
suspects contacted the victim's family in Nigeria and demanded a ransom of
US$10,000 (RM31,900) for the victim's release.
""The family alerted the victim's brother who is also studying in
Malaysia. He then lodged a police report the next day.""
Omar said the victim was released at 1.30am on Sunday in Cyberjaya after
his family deposited the money in several bank accounts in Nigeria and
Malaysia.
""The victim suffered injuries to the head, back and hands from assaults
by the kidnappers. He was given outpatient treatment at Serdang Hospital.""
Based on information from the brother, police raided a double-storey
terrace house in Jalan Damai Perdana, Cheras, at 3.45pm and detained four
Nigerians, a local woman and an Indonesian woman, aged between 20 and 30.
Police also seized three laptops, 15 handphones and 11 forged
international passports of various countries at the house.
Omar said police managed to trace one of the handphone numbers used to
contact the victim's family. The victim had also identified the suspects.
He said investigations revealed that the suspects might be involved in
other kidnap cases involving Nigerians.
""So far, in Selangor, there were two cases involving the same suspects.
We have summoned a victim who was kidnapped on Feb 18 and she had also
identified the suspects as her kidnappers.
""The victim, who is also a LimKokWing student, was released on Feb 24
after her family paid RM10,000 in ransom.
""We appeal to other victims who might not have lodged police reports or
have lodged reports at other police contingents to come forward to assist
in investigations.""
Omar said apart from running a kidnapping syndicate, the suspects, who
did not have any identification documents, were also believed to be
involved in forging international passports.
He said police would seek assistance from Interpol but had yet to
establish whether the suspects had links with international syndicates.
All six were remanded until June 27.

"70-year-old man behind boy's RM1m kidnapping
KUALA LUMPUR: A 7-year-old kidnap victim was released after his family
paid a ransom of RM1 million last week.
However, within days of the boy's release, police arrested 14 suspects
and recovered part of the ransom.
Investigations revealed that the kidnap was carried by a large gang
which was broken up into four groups. Each group had specific roles to
play and they were scattered across three states.
The boy was kidnapped early on April 10 when his mother was about to
drop him off at school near his house in Bandar Utama.
Federal Criminal Investigation Department director Datuk Seri Bakri
Zinin said a Proton Satria with four dark-skinned men stopped next to the
mother's car.
The mother was pushed to the ground and the kidnappers, armed with
sharp weapons, grabbed the boy before driving away with him.
Bakri said the mother tried to fight back but was injured. The
kidnappers drove past the security post and were believed to have pointed
the weapons at the guards who tried to stop the car.
The boy was believed to have been held in a condominium in Kepong for
four days while the kidnappers negotiated with his businessman father
over the ransom.
On April 14, the boy was released near the security post leading to his
home in Bandar Utama some 30 minutes after the ransom of RM1 million was
dropped off in front of a bank in Kepong Baru.
Acting on a tip-off, police began their first wave of arrests on April
21 where nine men and four women, between the ages of 19 and 70, were
arrested at several undisclosed locations in Selangor.
Bakri said RM319,700 of the ransom was also recovered from this group.
In follow-up operations, police picked up three other suspects in Bukit
Fraser, Pahang, Juasseh, Negri Sembilan and Serdang, Selangor. Bakri said
14 of the suspects have been remanded while two others were released.
Three of the suspects also have criminal records.
Initial investigations revealed that most of the suspects were car
repossessors and security guards while the women in the gang were
housewives.
Police believe that the oldest member of the gang, said to be a
70-year-old man, masterminded the kidnapping.
It was also learnt that police are probing the possibility that the
suspects were linked to the security guards in the housing estate or were
employees of the victim's father.
Bakri said they were looking for several other suspects. He said the
boy was still traumatised but was safe with his parents.
Meanwhile, police are looking for Paremsvaran Ramu @ Veera (IC
830625-05-5259) to assist in the investigations.
Paremsvaran's last known address was at 587/18A, Jalan Waterfall, Taman

"Angry wife kidnaps hubby's lover
RAWANG: A love triangle drove an enraged wife to kidnap and torture her
husband's lover for five days, and even demanded that he pay RM50,000
ransom for the woman's release.
The 36-year-old housewife also roped in her 32-year-old brother to
kidnap her 31-year-old rival, from her house in Rawang, on Friday.
They took the woman to a friend's home in Taman Saga, Ampang, where they
handcuffed her, tied her up and tortured her by assaulting her repeatedly.
And, to further humiliate the woman, they even snipped her long hair
short.
The suspect then used the victim's cellphone to taunt her husband over
the kidnapping.
The two also called him the next day to force him to listen to the
woman's pitiful cries as she was being beaten.
On Sunday, the wife met up with the husband at a hypermarket in Subang
to show him photographs of the victim looking frail from her ordeal as
proof.
However, it was only after the wife called him on Monday with the ransom
demand did the husband lodge a police report.

He said the two, together with three others, were arrested from various

However, he said the two had already released the victim somewhere in

"Body may be that of kidnapped teenager
Source:New Straits Times
PETALING JAYA: The body-in-the-suitcase could well be that of a kidnap
victim.
DNA samples taken from the body are being checked against those from a
family in Sepang who last Saturday had reported that their 19-year-old
son was missing.
Police on Friday said the decomposed body in a black 450cm by 609cm
suitcase was that of a teenager between the age of 14 and 19.
Post-mortem checks revealed that the victim died of suffocation. The
body had a plastic bag wrapped around the head.
It is now learnt that the missing college student was an asthmatic and
could have suffered an attack when his head was covered with the bag.
It was revealed the family had received three text messages saying that
their son was fine and if they wanted to see him again, they should pay
US$100,000 (RM370,000).
The body was found about 3pm on Thursday, on a slope in Damansara
Intan, next to the Damansara-Puchong Expressway. By then, investigations
into the kidnapping were in full swing.
The victim, who was not named, left his home in Sepang on Saturday
morning to pick up his girlfriend to take her to Universiti Malaya. He
never showed up.
His mother and girlfriend became frantic after calls to his mobile
phone went unanswered.
Recalling her son telling her that he was also going to meet his former
classmates in Bukit Jelutong, the mother went there to look for him.
Later that day, the family received the three text messages. They were
also warned not to go to the police.
The family, it is learnt, are in the jewellery business. The family
tried to negotiate and all contact with the kidnappers ended soon after.
Police got their first breakthrough on Friday night when they picked up
two Chinese nationals from Bukit Jelutong. Yesterday, they arrested two
more suspects in connection with the case. Police are still looking for
two other Chinese nationals.
The body was found in a foetal position in the suitcase. It was
stripped to the underwear and highly decomposed.
Forensic officers also took a comforter and three car mats from the
scene.

The suspect, who is from Jalan Waterfall in Taman Hijau, Rawang,
Selangor, went into hiding after learning police were in hot pursuit of
the gang members.
Federal Criminal Investigation Department director Datuk Seri Bakri
Zinin said the suspect played an important role in the kidnapping.
""Police are still looking for several other suspects. More arrests are
expected soon but the case is considered solved.""
The suspect has been remanded for a week since yesterday to facilitate
investigations.
Between April 21 and 23, police arrested 12 men and four women members
of the gang.
The suspects, aged between 19 and 70, were picked up at several
locations in the Klang Valley.

"Judge on seriousness of Sharma's kidnap allegation
Source:New Straits Times
KUALA LUMPUR, Tues. - The false information given by former RTM newsreader
Sharma Kumari was of the ""most serious nature"" as it involved an
accusation which carries a possible death sentence.
High Court judge Datuk Abdul Wahab Patail in his 48-page judgment
released to the Press today, further said that the entire matter might
have ended at Sharma's son's school after the police left, but it did not.
He said Sharma's action of lodging a police report about an hour after
the incident at the school, although in slightly different terms, did not
rule out kidnapping, clearly showed that she wished the matter to go much
further.
Yesterday, Abdul Wahab rejected Sharma's appeal against her conviction
and 12-week jail sentence for giving false information to a policeman.
Abdul Wahab also refused to grant a stay of execution of the jail term
pending an application by Sharma for leave to appeal to the Court of
Appeal.
Sharma, 40, whose real name is Sharma Kumari a/p Oam Prakash, was
charged with giving false information to L/Cpl Zamri Isthnin that four
Malay men were attempting to kidnap her son. By indicating that
businessman Abdullah Sani Mohd Hashim was the brother of one of the four,
she was alleged to have caused Zamri to question Abdullah Sani.
(Abdullah Sani is the brother of former executive chairman of Glamoir
World of Sports (M) Sdn Bhd Datuk Abdullah Hishan Mohd Hashim who is also
Sharma's former employer.)
The ""kidnap"" incident was said to have taken place in front of Sekolah
Kebangsaan Bukit Bandaraya, Jalan Bangkung, Bangsar, at 7.40am on Jan 5,
1998.
On July 24, last year, magistrate Mohamed Ilhami Idris sentenced Sharma
to 12 weeks' jail after finding her guilty.
""Had PW1 (Abdullah Sani) been arrested, and in view of the seriousness
of an allegation of involvement in kidnapping, a much serious sentence
would have been occasioned,"" said Abdul Wahab.
On the ground of appeal that Sharma was justified in giving the alleged
information to the policeman, Abdul Wahab said there was no basis for the
allegation that Abdullah Sani was involved in a kidnap attempt.
He said harassment, intimidation, including threat to kidnap, were quite
different from a kidnap attempt, which was the substance of Sharma's
information to the policeman and his duty partner.
On the ground that the magistrate had erred in not drawing an adverse
inference against the prosecution for not calling Abdullah Hishan in spite
of the evidence of intimidation and harassment by him given by Sharma,
Abdul Wahab said the ground had no merit as Abdullah Hishan was not part
of the prosecution case against Sharma.
""That allegation of any threat or harassment, even if true, has nothing
to do with the charge and the prosecution case which is about giving false
information against PW1 (Abdullah Sani),"" he said.
Abdul Wahab went on to say it was clear that the evidence advanced by
the defence did not relate to Abdullah Sani and it did not raise any
reasonable doubt to the charge against her, and her husband Pradeep Kumar
admitted that the matter (at the school) arose out of an attempt to serve
a writ of summons on her.

SHAH ALAM, Tues. - The 18-year-old kidnap victim rescued by police
yesterday may have been raped by four men on the first day of her ordeal
before being tied up and thrown into a car boot.
State Criminal Investigation Department chief Senior Assistant
Commissioner II Abu Bakar Mustafa said the traumatised victim was found
squatting in a house at Taman Desa Rahmat, Tampoi, Johor, when a special
police team  raided the place about 4pm.
""She was shivering in fear, crying and in a weak state when we found her
inside one of the rooms,"" he said at a Press conference today.
Also present at the conference held at the State police headquarters was
State deputy CID chief ACP Hasanudin Hassan.
""We took nearly an hour to calm her down and it took her awhile to
accept the fact that she had been rescued.""
Abu Bakar said police have arrested four suspects aged between 21 and 27
under Ops Scorpion.
Two of the suspects work as burger sellers while the other two were odd-
job workers.
The victim, a clerk, was abducted last Thursday after the kidnappers
rammed into her car near Kota Kemuning.
""They used the clerk's handphone to call her brother-in-law, who is a
businessman selling insurance.
""The abductors asked him to deposit either RM250,000 or RM100,000 into
her account no later than noon last Saturday,"" Abu Bakar said.
He added the kidnappers had also threatened the businessman that they
would cut off his sister-in-law's head if the demand was not met.
Due to time constraints, he said, the brother-in-law could only deposit
RM10,000 into her account and the kidnappers withdrew RM2,000 from two
automated teller machines in Johor and Malacca.
Yesterday, acting on information, police raided a house in Taman Sri
Muda here, about 11.30am and arrested two suspects.
They seized several items including two ATM cards, and RM1,300 believed
to be part of the ransom money.
During the Johor raid at Taman Desa Rahmat, police arrested the third
suspect about 4pm and seized two parang.
The police arrested the last suspect at another house.
""We have also learnt that the kidnappers initially planned to rob the
place where the clerk works, but later abandoned the idea and kidnapped
her instead,"" said Abu Bakar.
Police are investigating the case under Section 3 of the Kidnapping Act
1961 (amended 1977) under which the offenders can be hanged or face life
imprisonment and whipping if found guilty.

SHAH ALAM, Sat. - A 52-year-old man, suspected to have masterminded two

being questioned at the Selangor police headquarters yesterday.
A team of policemen was recording Choong Lek's cautioned statement at
the State Serious Crime branch in connection with one of the kidnappings
when the man, who was not handcuffed, dashed across the floor and leapt
through the glass window pane before falling on a motorcycle shed and
hitting the ground about 12.30pm.
There were no steel grilles on the window.
Choong, who had head and neck injuries, was taken in a police four-wheel
drive vehicle to a hospital but died on the way.
State police chief Datuk Kamaruddin Hamzah said today a police party
arrested Choong in Kepong yesterday about 7am following interrogation of
five men believed to be his accomplices in the kidnap.
He said the five were detained by police in Petaling Jaya and Kuala
Lumpur on March 24 following the release of a nine-year-old schoolgirl
after her parents had paid RM300,000 ransom on March 3.
The gang had initially demanded RM500,000 when it kidnapped the girl
while she was on her way to a school in Selangor on March 1.
Kamaruddin said Choong was believed to be the mastermind behind two
kidnappings, including the one involving the schoolgirl, in the Klang
Valley since May last year.
""Policemen were recording his cautioned statement in connection with one
of the kidnappings when he suddenly stood up and stunned the policemen by
leaping through the glass window pane.""
He said police could not do anything as the incident happened very fast.
Kamaruddin said police investigations had also revealed that the gang
was involved in another kidnapping in Kuala Lumpur on May 27 last year.
In the incident last year, a seven-year-old schoolboy was released after
a RM180,000 ransom was paid.

curtain.
He was then driven to a house in Petaling Jaya where he was detained
for six days.
His eyes were taped and his cries for mercy and pleas to see his
grandmother were ignored by his three abductors.
Wong, who was not in good health, developed a fever and had difficulty
breathing.
When the men learnt that the boy's family had alerted the police who
were hot on their trail, they abandoned their mission and released him at
a nearby factory.
Yesterday, Wong's three abductors were sentenced to five years' jail
each by the High Court here after they admitted committing the offence.
Optician Moong Wee Liam @ William, 35, labourer Chung Chee Pin, 31, and
aircon technician Wan Kee Yew, 30, pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of
abducting Wong at Wan's rented house at Jalan SS2/57, Petaling Jaya at
4.30pm on Feb 4, 2005.
They were initially charged with kidnap under the Kidnapping Act, which
carries the death sentence, but the prosecution reduced the charge to one
under the Penal Code, which carries a maximum sentence of seven years'
jail or fine.
Judge Datuk Syed Ahmad Helmy Syed Ahmad ordered the men to serve the
sentence from the date of their arrest on Feb 9, 2005.
In pressing for a deterrent sentence, DPP Wan Shaharuddin Wan Ladin
said a heavy sentence must be meted out to teach the three men and
would-be offenders a lesson.
Counsel Ashok Kandiah, Naran Singh and Rejinder Singh, who were
representing Moong, Chung and Wan, respectively, pleaded for leniency.

MANILA, Oct. 5 (Oana-PNA) -- No amnesty for Galib Andang, alias

kidnappings in Sulu and Malaysia.
This was the categorical statement of Press Secretary Ricardo Puno Jr.

Relations Officers of the Philippines (PROP) in Camp Aguinaldo Wednesday.
When told that Robot would like to have a second chance to live a

""Absolutely none.""
Robot and his Abu Sayyaf gang had kidnapped over 30 foreign and
Filipino nationals here and abroad. He was tagged as the kidnapper of 21
mostly foreign tourists in the diving resort of Sipadan, Malaysia last
April 23.
He also abducted two French journalists, 13 preachers of the Jesus
Miracle Crusade (JMC), three Malaysians, two media personnel of ABS-CBN and
one American.
All except five of their kidnapped victims have been released or
rescued by government forces.
Puno said Robot and his gang are answerable to the crime they have
committed. Under the law, kidnapping is punishable by lethal injection.
He said Robot's desire to turn a new leaf and live a peaceful life is
possible, but first he has to pay his debt to society.
""Let the law takes its course,"" Puno said.
Robot was reported to have repented for the crimes he committed,
because he wants a second chance at life and return to his retinue of
wives.
Col. Jaime Canatoy, commanding officer of the AFP Civil Relations

"DATUK CLAIMS TRIAL TO 20 COUNTS OF MONEY LAUNDERING
Court-Datuk
KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 2 (Bernama) -- A businessman, with a ""Datuk"" title,
claimed trial to 20 counts of money laundering amounting to RM1.29 million
in the Sessions Court today.
Datuk Paiman Shakimon, 48, allegedly used the money to open six fixed-
deposit accounts, paid deposit and monthly instalments for his fleet of
cars, and bought a piece of land in Kajang.
Two of his cars are Mercedes-Benz, Nissan Fairlady, Toyota Celica,
Subaru Impreza and Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution.
Paiman, who is involved in information technology business, was charged
with committing the offences between Jan 10, 2005 and July 10 2006.
He allegedly committed the offences at EON Bank in Jalan Raja Laut;
Alliance Bank in Bangsar; Maybank in Desa Pandan; United Overseas Bank and
at Naza Motor Trading Sdn Bhd.
Other offences were committed at CIMB Bank in Jalan Melaka, Nikko Hotel
at Jalan Ampang, Standard Chartered Bank at Jalan Sultan Ismail and HSBC
Bank Malaysia in Leboh Ampang.
Paiman was charged under sub-section 4(1)(a) of the Anti-Money
Laundering and Anti-Terrorism Financing Act 2001, which carries RM5 million
in maximum fine or five years' jail, or both, if convicted.
Sessions Judge S. Komathy released Paiman on RM50,000 bail and
impounded his passport.
Earlier, DPP Mohammad Saifuddin Hashim Musaimi urged the court to
impose RM200,000 bail owing to the severity of the offences.
Counsel Christopher Fernando appealed to the court for a lesser bail as
the assets of Paiman, his wife, and his immediate family members have been
sealed.
He told the court it would be difficult for Paiman to post a high bail
with all his assets frozen. Paiman's family posted bail.
On Sept 28, Paiman claimed trial to four counts of cheating involving
investments totalling RM3,929,370 between May 2005 and August 2006. He was
freed on RM100,000 bail.
Komathy set Nov 5 for submission on a request from Saifuddin for a
joint trial.

"MALAYSIA CAN HELP TO CHECK MONEY LAUNDERING, SAYS MAHATHIR
Mahathir-dadah
KUALA LUMPUR, March 3 (Bernama) -- Malaysia will cooperate with the
United States to check the laundering of dadah money but is against any
move to extend enforcement of US laws to the country, Datuk Seri Dr
Mahathir Mohamad said today.
The Prime Minister said the existence of offshore banking centres, like
in Labuan, did not mean that money laundering would be a problem in the
country.
""We ourselves do not like this activity (money laundering) but where is
the proof that we are involved?"" he told reporters on his return here from
Bangkok where he attended the Asia-Europe summit.
He was commenting on the 1996 International Narcotics Control Strategy
Report, which was released in Washington yesterday, that Malaysia has taken
some very strong measures in the counter-narcotics area, but gave ""medium""
priority to money laundering.
Dr Mahathir said money laundering occurred in certain places, including
in the US, and that country should concentrate on matters within its
jurisdiction and not try to exercise ""extra territorial rights"".
""We can cooperate with them but it is not their right to come here to
arrest people and bring them back for trial according to their laws. We
consider this a violation of our independence,"" he said.
Dr Mahathir said if the West could accuse Malaysia of lacking laws
against money laundering, Malaysia could blame them for not doing enough to
fight the dadah menace.
The rampant dadah trafficking in various parts of the world was due to
the big market for illicit drugs in developed countries, including the US
and in Europe, he said.
Dadah consuming countries were as responsible for the problem as the
producing countries, he said.
""Some people in the West feel that tobacco and marijuana are more or
less the same, so what is wrong with smoking it?"" he said.
The report also said Malaysia's ""asset seizure law is narrow in scope
and has had only limited success in confiscating drug money"". -- Bernama

will carry out a thorough investigation to identify the mastermind behind
business operations including hotels and major restaurants which are funded
by money derived from smuggling activities while covering up the actual
illegal activities.
Deputy Finance Minister Datuk Dr Ng Yen Yen said so far two companies
would be investigated after they were found to be involved in business
using funds obtained from smuggling activities.
""These companies are found to have violated the Anti-Money Laundering

Ng said the Finance Ministry had given KDRM approval to enforce the Act
immediately in efforts to prevent money laundering.
""Intelligence information is still being gathered and updated to
identify other properties involved,"" she said, adding that KDRM officers
investigating the cases were knowledgeable in law and aspects on financial

Ng said investigation into the money laundering activities took a long
time because it would leave no stone unturned to identify the mastermind.
Under the Anti-Money Laundering Act, the properties of the businessmen
involved could be sealed and they could be imprisoned.
She also reminded businessmen especially those in the restaurant, hotel
and insurance sectors to register their businesses with the KDRM although
the government had abolished temporarily the service tax licence.
She said the registration was necessary to enable the KDRM to keep the

Senate-Money
KUALA LUMPUR, June 6 (Bernama) -- The Anti Money Laundering Draft Bill
will empower the government to confisticate the assets of those involved in
money laundering, said Deputy Finance Minister Datuk Dr Shafie Mohd Salleh.
He said Chapter 6 of the draft bill provided for a freeze, seal, and
confistication of assets of anybody suspected of money laundering.
Powers to freeze the assets of anybody suspected of money laundering
would cease if the suspect is not charged with any of the offences
stipulated under the Bill, he said during the winding-up debate on the bill
in the Dewan Negara today.
In reply to a question from Senator Hassan Shukri on the action by some
quarters to legalise money laundering, Dr Shafie said before the existence
of this bill, Malaysia was exercising law provisions which were contained
in other existing Acts.
The provisions are contained among others under Section 3 and 4 of the
Dangerous Drygs Act (Asset Confistication) 1988, Section 18 of the Anti
Corruption Act 1997 and Section 411 to Section 414 of the Penal Code.
Dr Shafie said under the draft bill, money laundering was a serious
offence and the ill-gotten gains were just as illegal as drug trafficking,
corruption and offences under the Penal Code.

KUALA LUMPUR, July 6 (Bernama) -- Malaysia has again reiterated its
pledge towards supporting the international community in its fight against
money laundering and terrorist financing.
""The fight against terrorist financing, money laundering and abuses of
the global financial system is a shared responsibility of the international
community. Malaysia pledges to work together to curb and eradicate all
forms of money laundering,"" said Deputy Finance Minister Datuk Dr Shafie
Mohd Salleh at the 4th ASEM Finance Ministers Meeting in Copenhagen,
Denmark yesterday. The text of his speech was released by the finance

In his speech, entitled ""Combating the Financing of Terrorism, Money
Laundering and the Abuses of the Global Financial System,"" the deputy
minister said there was a need for a consolidated international effort to
counter the problem and that Malaysia had taken several measures towards
it.
Among them had been the implementation of the legal and institutional
framework including appropriate money laundering laws, and the development
of appropriate counter-measures such as the sharing of information and
co-operation among law enforcement agencies.
He said Malaysia became a member of the Asia/Pacific Group on Money
Laundering (APG) in 2002, a platform to share knowledge and experiences
relating to counter money laundering and solutions towards the problem.
As money laundering and terrorist financing activities are
multilateral, multi-institutional and multi-jurisdictional, Dr Shafie said
it is crucial that comprehensive international efforts be waged to combat

and deter money laundering as well as the freeze, seizure, and forfeiture
of the proceeds of serious crimes.
It also provides for international co-operation among authorities for
the sharing of information and investigation relating to any money
laundering offence, he said.
Toward this, he said Malaysia's central bank, Bank Negara Malaysia, has
been appointed as the authority to implement the provisions of the AMLA,

DUBAI, July 7 (Bernama) -- A United Arab Emirates (UAE) Central Bank
official has asserted that this Gulf nation is free of any signs of money
laundering.
Assistant executive director and head of the anti-money laundering and

tough policy on combating money laundering, with more related agreements to be

UAE nationals or expatriates, to deposit money with them directly for
investments in large projects.
He said the bank had warned about the danger of such people on many
occasions.
""It has issued circulars to encourage people to invest their money through

"THREE SINGAPOREANS JAILED IN CHINA FOR MONEY LAUNDERING
Singaporeans-Jailed
BEIJING, Aug 7 (Bernama) -- Three Singaporeans and a native Chinese
were jailed by a Shanghai court Monday for laundering 5.3 billion yuan
worth of foreign currencies abroad, the state media reported.
Thirty-year-old Loh Foy Tau, named as the leader of the gang, and
fellow Singaporean Mok Kwok Kee were sentenced to 14 years jail and a third
Singaporean, Lee Kee Yong, was jailed for 13 years, China Daily said.
Local Chen Peixiang, who is from eastern Fujian province, received nine
years.
China Daily said they had operated money transfers between China and
foreign countries without authorisation.
The Bank of Communications branch in Pudong tipped off Shanghai's
anti-money laundering unit early last year after Loh visited the bank
almost every day to transfer large amounts of money.
It led to a raid on an Internet foreign currency exchange in Tianjin
which was a major client of the gang. The Internet firm allegedly cheated
clients of millions of yuan by promising access to foreign currencies,
margin trading and high profits for small deposits.
China had tightened rules to curb money laundering since last year,

"CHECKING MONEY LAUNDERING IN THE COMMONWEALTH
LONDON, June 8 (Bernama) -- Money laundering is a thriving business
that is now threatening to swamp the globe with an estimated US$500 billion
every year, bringing with it real threats to the integrity and control of
financial institutions, wreaking havoc with the smaller economies and
sullying all that come into contact with the proceeds.
The funds could have a variety of dubious origins - from the proceeds
of drug trade, blackmail, extortion, tax evasion, arms trafficking and
other activities of organised crime.
These activities generally deal in cash which have to be ""laundered"" to
bring them back into the mainstream economy and respectability.
Commonwealth Finance Ministers meeting in Kingston, Jamaica in October
last year agreed that measures must be taken in the financial sector of
their respective countries to allay this threat to their national
economies.
The recommendations were drawn up at a meeting of Commonwealth senior
finance officials earlier in the year in Colombo, Sri Lanka.
Senior finance officials from 39 Commonwealth countries, including
Malaysia, met again here for a two-day meeting last Tuesday to look, in the
words of the Commonwealth's Deputy Secretary General of Economic and Social
Affairs Sir Humphrey Maude, ""at the upshot of the Colombo meeting"".
They also studied returns from the self-evaluation questionnaire given
to member countries to gauge their experience in implementing the forty
recommendations made by the OECD's Financial Action Task Force (FATF).
The FATF, initially set up by the OECD in 1989, is now an independant
grouping of countries and regions established to combat money laundering.
Of the 26 governments represented, five are from the Commonwealth -
Australia, Britain, Canada, New Zealand and Singapore.
The FATF recommendations for governments and financial institutions
have been accepted as one of the most comprehensive bases for action
against money laundering and were commended by the Commonwealth heads of
government in 1993.
Commenting on responses to the questionnaire, Sir Humphrey said it
showed that Commonwealth countries are having a mixed experience and that
non-bank institutions are lagging behind in implementing the measures.
With quick facility transfers that are now available, money laundering
is becoming a global and no longer just a regional threat.
It is true that some Commonwealth countries in the West Indies and the
Indian Ocean states are becoming particular targets but now even the
African states, which never thought that they would be the focus of
interest, are gaining the attention of international money launderers.
Money launderers ""clean"" their cash haul by the simple act of
placement, by layering, or by integration.
They target not only banks and other financial institutions such as
bureaux de change but also the non-financial sectors such as trading
companies.
Huge sums of money are sometimes brought in under the pretext of aiding
ailing economies.
All these methods take many forms. The objective of ""placement"" is to
move cash into the non-cash.
In ""layering"", many transactions are carried out between the placement
and the final goal in order to hide the source of the money and to obtain
the end-result of making it respectable.
In ""integration"", a money launderer may target a legitimate business
and help it to greater growth by injecting much-needed capital.
The criminals may end up with the ownership of the company itself, and
with it, respectability.
The Marlborough House meeting of the Commonwealth's senior finance
officials concluded last Wednesday that countries with the most successful
programme of implementation were those with a high level steering group of
representatives from a wide range of interested governmental, law
enforcement and regulatory bodies all working in concert to implement a
national strategy.
As money launderers traverse the globe looking for opportunities,
delegates also emphasised the need for countries to have a central agency
to receive and diffuse reports of suspicious transactions to the approriate
With rapid developments in the banking and financial sectors, there may
also be other problems.
""It was widely recognised that the necessary processes of economic
liberalisation deregulation in many countries might in themselves reduce
the documentation and records available to law enforcement agencies for use
in combating money launders.
""This created additional challenges for policy makers who needed to
maintain strong defences against criminality, without undermining the
benefits of liberalisation,"" Jeremy Heywood, Head of Securities and
Marketing Policy at the Treasury and chairman of the meeting said.
A concrete plan from the meeting was the ""Blue Book"", an 84-page
discussion document containing guidance notes for the financial sector to
combat money laundering. The document will be finalised at the Commonwealth
Finance Minister's meeting in Bermuda in September as a basis for further
action.
There is, however, one aspect of money laundering still which has not
been adequately discussed in the ""Blue Book"" and which did not feqature in
the OECD recommendations because its component members' lack of exposure to
it. This covers the channeling of money through the ""parallel economy"".
Addressing this issue, Heywood said,""This particular problem posed to
some countries by the parallel economy required further study. The
Commonwealth Secretariat could do further work in this area.""
Summing up the strategy for this common front against money laundering,
Rumman Faruqi, Director of the Economic Affairs Division at the
Commonwealth Secretariat said,""We will have to proceed at more or less the
same pace. Otherwise those who lag behind might be targetted"". -- BERNAMA

"SHAFIE TABLES ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING BILL
Parliament-money laundering
KUALA LUMPUR, May 9 (Bernama) -- Deputy Finance Minister Datuk Dr
Shafie Mohd Salleh today tabled in the Dewan Rakyat here a bill to curb
money laundering which could pose a threat to the country's financial
sector.
He said the bill would make it a serious offence to launder money
obtained from activities such as drug trafficking, corruption, kidnapping,
robbery, human trade, gambling, vice and fraud.
Putting money obtained illegal into legal businesses or referred to as
money laundering is an international issue which required global action, he
said when tabling the Ant-Money Laundering Bill 2001.
For Malaysia, Dr Shafie said money laundering could jeopardise its
financial sector, including the Off Shore Financial Centre in Labuan.
""It could also pose a threat to our efforts to turn Kuala Lumpur as a
regional financial centre,"" he said.
Dr Shafie said several international organisations such as the United
Nations, Financial Action Task Force On Money Laundering (FATF), Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), International Monetary Fund (IMF),
World Bank, Financial Stability Forum and Bank of International Settlement
(BIS) had given focus on money laundering.
He said that in June last year, the FATF had listed 15 countries and
territories as ""Non Cooperative Countries and Territories"" in efforts to
curb money laundering and to urge countries and territories concerned to
update their laws and practices.
He said Malaysia did not have a specific law on money laundering
although there were provisions on illegally acquired money in Dangerous
Drugs Act 1988, Anti-Corruption Act 1997 and the Penal Code.
""As such, the bill is formulated to make preventive action against
money laundering more effective and can be used in general as well as in
meeting international standard,"" he said.
Dr Shafie said the bill would provide for a financial intelligence
organisation, entrusted with the task of collecting, analysing and
disseminating information on financial transactions that were doubtful and
unusual.
He said it was also aimed at strengthening the detection and
investigation process to acquire evidence to prove a money laundering
offence as well as allowing money and assets obtained from such activity to
be freezed, forfeited and sealed.
It also contained provision for the offence of money laundering, the
prevention, detection and prosecution of money laundering, the forfeiture
of property derived from, or involved in, money laundering and the
requirements of record-keeping and reporting of suspicious transactions by
reporting institutions, he said
Dr Shafie said the bill also provided a fine of not more than RM5
million or jail not more than five years or both for those found to be
involved in or collaborate in money laundering.

"MONEY-LAUNDERING AND TERRORIST FINANCING COMPLIANCE ISSUES
MONEY-LAUNDERING
KUALA LUMPUR, July 9, (Bernama) -- The Institute of Bankers Malaysia (IBBM)
and the Compliance Officers' Networking Group of Malaysia (CONG) will be hosting
a two-day International Conference on Financial Crime and Terrorism Financing
(IFCTF) 2010 from 19-20 July at a leading hotel here.
The IFCTF 2010, with the theme 'Strengthening Governance to Derive Value',
is organised jointly with the Asian Institute of Finance (AIF), the Securities
Industry Development Corporation (SIDC) and the Malaysian Insurance Institute
(MII), with support from Bank Negara Malaysia.
The organisers have lined up eminent local and international speakers and
subject matter experts from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), The World
Bank, US Treasury, Australian Federal Police, AUSTRAC, Asia Pacific Group on
Money Laundering (APG), international banks and consultancy firms, Bank Negara
Malaysia, Securities Commission, Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) and Ministry
of International Trade and Industry (Miti)
Some of the key issues that will be deliberated upon are risk based measures
to deal with high risk customers and countries, money laundering and terrorism
financing risks in cross border transfers, trade financing and Islamic finance.
Other topics include corruption, human trafficking and ponzi schemes.
THE NEED FOR A SOUND COMPLIANCE SYSTEM
According to CONG chairman V. Maslamani, financial institutions operate in a
dynamic environment influenced by market globalisation, industry consolidation,
convergence of financial services, emerging technology - including the security
threats that come with it.
These forces combine to create inherent risk, and one of the key risks faced
by a financial institution is compliance risk. To mitigate risks and remain
competitive and profitable in such an environment, banks need to continuously
assess and modify their products, services and operational security measures in
the wake of new legislation to address developments in the marketplace.
""Regulators expect banks to have in place a robust risk management process
to manage all the risks inherent in banking business including compliance risk,""
said Maslamani to Bernama.
Banks must develop and maintain a sound compliance system that is integrated
into the risk management strategy of the organisation. The bank's compliance
management system must ensure adequate compliance to regulatory and internal
requirements.
To achieve these, financial institutions must judiciously invest in capacity
building and adequately trained manpower to assist in mitigating undue risk
facing these organisations.
CONG, an advisory committee of IBBM has been working on many initiatives to
inject professionalism and to enhance capacity building of the compliance
officers in Malaysia.
In pursuit of these objectives, CONG actively works with regulators and
learning institutions in Malaysia to raise the level of professionalism in the
compliance function and introduce capacity building programs in the banking
industry.
IFCTF 2010 is one such programme to raise the level of awareness in Malaysia
on the international best practices of Anti-Money Laundering and Counter
Financing of Terrorism measures.
""The IFCTF 2010 is the conduit for local financial institutions to learn
from the experts on the current and future requirements. The deliberation during
the conference will allow compliance officers to align and improve their AML/CFT
compliance program,"" Maslamani added.
THE CHALLENGE FACING BANKING INSTITUTIONS
The ever changing global regulatory and governance requirements pose a great
challenge for financial institutions to keep up. With regulatory reform and
consumer protection high on the agenda, banks endlessly face new pressures on
several fronts.
Failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules or code of conduct, or other
acceptable standards carries the weight of legal or regulatory sanctions that
inevitably would have an adverse impact to earnings, capital or reputation.
""The challenge for financial institutions is to keep pace with the external
developments. They need to invest in technology and manpower, develop education
programmes, and find technology solutions that will help protect them from
threats posed by criminals ranging from fraudsters, skimmers, money launderers
and terrorist financiers. These criminals operate under the cover of
legitimate-looking businesses that might not be suspected until it's too late,""
Maslamani explained.
RED FLAGS
The FATF is the international standard setter with respect to countering
money laundering and terrorism financing. The FATF '40+9 Recommendations'
currently sets the international standards for combating money laundering (ML)
and terrorist financing (TF), which must be adhered with by financial
institutions worldwide.
""Financial institutions must develop written programmes that identifies and
detects the relevant warning signs of financial crimes and terrorism
financing. Constant revision and sharing of the red flags will assist staff at
the frontline to detect financial crime and terrorism financing,"" Maslamani
revealed.
The Malaysian banking industry has made significant strides in money
laundering detection and prevention through the Anti-Money Laundering Act (AMLA)
2001 and Know Your Customer (KYC) Policy.
Subsequently, AMLA 2001 Act was updated in 2003 and is now known as the
Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorism Financing (AMLA-ATFA) Act 2001 to
include terrorist financing.
But with increasingly volatile political and economic developments, coupled
with recurring financial crisis in several parts of the globe, banks continue to
be vulnerable to money laundering and financing of terrorism.
Dubious organisations and individuals are exploiting vulnerabilities in the
international trade and banking systems to move money from illegal sources or
for illegal purposes.
The war against terrorism financing relies on international cooperation and
common accepted rules, objectives and motives. It requires new tools and new
methods.
COMPLYING WITH THE RULES
On April 5, 2010, Malaysia introduced the Strategic Trade Bill specifically
designed to provide control over the trade of materials like electronics,
avionics and software, which could be linked to WMD.
The Strategic Trade Bill deters individuals or corporations from using
Malaysia as a base for illegal arms deal.
More importantly, the Bill facilitates closer partnership between Malaysia
and the rest of the world in the global fight against terrorism and the
proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.
Maslamani suggests that financial institution's Compliance Programme be
mandated and managed by the Board of Directors or senior management, and at the
very minimum, should include appropriate staff training as part and parcel of
managing compliance risks.
""Going forward, while compliance requirements should ideally be part of the
daily routine of management and employees of financial institutions, the
ultimate responsibility still rests with the Board of Directors. They can
delegate but not abdicate and the management must be responsible for ensuring
that the Board of Directors have an effective oversight,"" Maslamani reminded.

today.
He said the Malaysian police would work together with their Thai

The gang members, who forged their brotherhood at the Simpang Renggam

Ramli said that under AMLA, the assets acquired by the gang can be

He said the couple extended good cooperation to the central bank as
they wanted to prove they were not guilty.
""If they had wanted to abscond, they would have done so long ago as
their passports were not impounded,"" he added.
Leong urged the court to reduce the RM500,000 to RM50,000 as it was
difficult for his client to come up with RM500,000 even to raise from her
relatives as they were all government retirees living from hand to mouth.
Objecting to the request, Muhammad Saifuddin said the high penalty for

"PARLIAMENT: ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING (AMENDMENT) BILL TABLED
KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 10 (Bernama) -- The Anti-Money Laundering (Amendment)
Bill 2003 was tabled in the Dewan Rakyat today to widen the powers of the
Act to handle financing of terrorists.
Deputy Minister of Finance Datuk Dr Shafie Salleh, who tabled the Bill,
said there were no specific provisions to deal with financing of terrorists
except through serious crime under the Penal Code.
""However, even the provisions in the Penal Code are said to be not
comprehensive. Hence, a specific amendment encompassing the definition and
offences related to financing of terrorists is needed,"" he said.
The proposed amendments provide for forfeiture of assets of terrorists
and properties acquired from money-laundering activities and financing
terrorists.
The amendments would also streamline several original provisions to add
more clout to the enforcement of the Act, he said.
""Amendments to the Act will render financing terror activities as an
offence under national laws apart from putting in place a mechanism to
control, monitor and supervise in line with requirements of the United
Nations Security Council's Convention and Resolutions,"" he added.

"LADY DOCTOR UNDER PROBE FOR US$12 MILLION MONEY-LAUNDERING SCAM
Doctor-Fraud
KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 11 (Bernama) -- Authorities, including Bank Negara
Malaysia, are investigating an Ipoh-based lady doctor under the Anti-Money
Laundering Act 2001 for alleged fraudulent transfer of a US$12 million
(RM45.6 million) loan secured early this year through dubious means from a
German company.
Bernama reliably learnt that federal police Commercial Crime Division
officers picked up the doctor on July 9 after being alerted by Pengurusan
Danaharta Nasional Bhd officials.
Police confirmed that the woman was freed on police bail on July 16,
pending further directive from the Attorney-General's Chambers.
A police source familiar with the investigations said two accountants,
a businessman and officials of a Hamburg-based multinational are assisting
the authorities in their investigation.
Bernama learnt that the alleged scam involved defrauding the Hamburg
company into releasing a US$12 million (RM45.6 million) loan and fraudulent
transfer of the monies to Malaysia last February.
Bukit Aman Commercial Crime Division officers picked up the doctor upon
being alerted by Danaharta officials who suspected irregularities when she
submitted three bank drafts totalling RM29 million despite her failure
earlier to secure loans from several local banks and financial
institutions.
The money was allegedly for part payment for her acquisition of a
pharmaceutical company.
The German company approved the loan to her upon being furnished with
details of her company's profile and supporting documents including
""promissory notes"" and it then facilitated the transfer of the US$12
million loan to the doctor's account at a bank in Batu Gajah on Feb 13.
The bank branch, however, refused to accept the money since transaction
exceeding RM5 million requires Bank Negara's approval.
Yet, an alleged scam was worked out to transfer RM30 million of the
total loan to Malaysia via six companies at RM5 million per company
belonging to associates of a London businessman introduced to the doctor.
Bernama learnt that Bank Negara officials later traced those
transactions to a London-based businessman and uncovered his complicity in
the alleged scam.
At the same time, the German multinational directed its Kuala Lumpur
office to countercheck signatures on 10 promissory notes required for the
loan and they were later found to have been forged.
Bernama also learnt that the German multinational has filed a police
report on the matter and that Bank Negara has ordered a local bank to
freeze the doctor's bank account.

"STRONG REGIMES NEEDED TO STEM MONEY LAUNDERING, TERRORIST FINANCING
SINGAPORE-MONEY LAUNDERING
SINGAPORE, July 13 (Bernama) -- Every country needs to have in place robust
anti-money laundering and counter terrorist-financing regimes if they want to
effectively stem global criminal and terrorist activities, an Asia Pacific group
meeting heard today.
Opening the 13th Annual Meeting of the Asia-Pacific Group on Money
Laundering here, Singapore Law Minister K Shanmugam said a country could not act
alone in fighting this global menace.
""It is not enough for a country to have a national-level response to defeat
a transnational enemy,"" the minister said.
He said the ease at which capital could now move across global financial
markets had presented criminals and terrorists with opportunities to move their
resources quickly, and hide their tracks.
For the regimes to be successful, they should be effective on all fronts
from enforcement, detection and deterrence to prevention, Shanmugam said.
He said only when jurisdictions had in place regimes capable of not only
catching and penalising launderers and terrorist financiers, but also deterring
them from action would the region be much safer from criminal and terrorist
elements.
The minister said without funding, criminals and terrorists would not be
able to carry out their activities for long, and their survival depended on
their continued ability to manipulate flows of money through financial systems.
He said advances in technology, such as pre-paid cards, mobile payments and
internet payment services, had made the task of enforcement agencies and
regulatory authorities more difficult as criminals and terrorists had learnt to
use these technologies to their advantage.
Shanmugam also said the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an
inter-governmental body that develops and promotes national and international
policies to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, needed to develop
new ways to measure a regime's effectiveness in deterring financial crimes,
focusing not only on conviction rates, but measuring the actual level of
deterrence and disruption on the group.--BERNAMA

"MODEL LAW TO TACKLE MONEY LAUNDERING
Law-money
KUALA LUMPUR, April 16 (Bernama) -- Cooperation in tackling the problem
of money laundering including the attempt to provide a harmonious legal
framework on the basis of a model law was discussed at the Commonwealth Law
Ministers Meeting here today.
The ministers agreed that international cooperation is vital in dealing
with the problem as it involves transborder activity, said Prof Reg Austin,
the director of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Division at the
Commonwealth Secretariat.
Briefing reporters on the outcome of the second day of the meeting, he
said the model law, being produced by the Secretariat, could be used by
member states to enable them to cooperate effectively.
Covering all aspects of the problem, the model law is drawn from
related laws in some member countries especially those which had a
well-established financial and banking system.
But he said the model law is not an attempt to lay down a particular
law for anybody as it is meant to provide optional provisions that member
countries could choose according to their needs.
""Countries which may be attractive to investors, may attract not only
legitimate investors but also attract those who want to use its banking
system for criminal reasons,"" he said.
Commonweath Deputy Secretary-General K.Srinivasan said that in
discussing money laundering, some delegations also raised the question of
illegal trafficking in narcotics and psychotrophic substance as these
crimes were frequently related. --Bernama

"BANK NEGARA: NEED TO STRENGTHEN ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING EFFORTS
ZAMANI-FINANCING
KUALA LUMPUR, April 16 (Bernama) -- Efforts to strengthen the anti-money
laundering and the combating of the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) regime
needs to be intensified to maintain financial stability, according to Bank
Negara Malaysia.
Its deputy governor Datuk Zamani Abdul Ghani said robust AML/CFT regimes
could benefit individual countries as enhanced financial sector integrity and
stability facilitated their integration into the global financial system.
""They will also contribute to more transparent governance and effective
fiscal administration,"" he said in his keynote address at the International
Financial Crime and Terrorism Financing Conference 2009 here today.
Zamani said the lack of AML/CFT regime could contribute to undermine the
soundness and stability of financial institutions and systems, discourage
foreign investment, and distort international capital flows.
""The global financial crisis amplifies such risks,"" he said.
For Malaysia, the government has put in place a strategic focus in
strengthening the national AML/CFT regime, Zamani said.
Collaboration and cooperation among key stakeholders is strengthened and the
public-private sector partnership enhanced as synchronised actions deliver
better result, he said.
Zamani said the move to increase resources for money laundering and
terrorism financing investigations by the domestic law enforcement agencies,
which currently is the emerging trend, needed to be supported with swift actions
from Bank Negara's Financial Intelligence Unit and prompt response from
reporting institutions.
""Another is that, at the international level, Malaysia will continue to
enhance multilateral and bilateral relationships,"" he said.
According to Zamani, there is also a need to provide greater focus in
enhancing the competency and capacity of key stakeholders, especially the
analysts, law enforcement officers and compliance officers.
""We plan to roll out capacity building programmes for analysts and
enforcement officers covering fundamental, intermediate and advance level
training programmes,"" he said.
The Certified Financial Investigators Programme, Bank Negara's flagship
basic programme for financial investigators, has produced 83 investigators with
knowledge on the Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorism Financing Act 2001 as
well as financial investigation techniques.
""It also important to further improve the quality of analysis and improve
the compliance level among the reporting institutions in order to preserve the
integrity and stability of the financial system,"" Zamani said.
""We expect the board of directors and senior management of institutions to
play their roles in ensuring that the compliance programme is fully implemented
and that any money laundering and terrorism financing activities are promptly
detected and reported,"" he said. -- BERNAMA

AUSTRALIA-LAUNDERING
MELBOURNE, April 16 (Bernama) -- The Australian government is cracking down
on money laundering and terrorism financing with the new Anti-Money Laundering
and Counter-Terrorism Financing Rules effective from today.
The Australian Associated Press reported that the new rules would allow the
country's anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing regulator to
remove a person's name and details from the register of providers of designated
remittance services.
Money transfer service providers must be registered to operate legally, it
added.
Home Affairs Minister Brendan O'Connor who announced the new rules, stressed
that the new powers given to the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis
Centre were targeted at preventing serious crimes and would not affect the
majority of providers.
""The new rules will reduce the risk of money remitters facilitating access
to funds for money laundering, terrorism financing, and other serious crimes
such as people smuggling.
""These changes will combat the abuse of Australia's financial system by
those who seek to profit from crime,"" he said in a statement.
The new rules also allow money transfer service providers to form a
designated business group.
""This particular amendment will be beneficial to relevant businesses as they
will be able to take advantage of the efficiencies which result from being able
to form a designated business group,"" O'Connor said.
The structure allows associated businesses to share customer identity
information and have a joint anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism
financing programme.
It also allows a member of the group to lodge group compliance reports and
allows a member to discharge various record-keeping obligations under the laws.

Initially the reforms will involve the financial and gambling

Once in place the Australian Government would then consider extending

Ellison said it represented a significant stage in Australia's

between the Australian Government, industry and the public to ensure the
proposed reforms minimise the impact on legitimate business activity and
members of the public,"" he said in a statement.
""The Government agreed to implement the FATF recommendations in two

appropriate records and maintain rigorous internal anti-money laundering

activity, he explained that financial institutions are potential funnels towards
the flow of both illicit and legitimate money to terrorist-destined funds.
According to Azman, the scenario is compounded by the spate of regional and
global financial contagions which amplify the risk.
In addition, he said techniques of terrorism financing are constantly
evolving, making detection difficult.
""As with most illegal or criminal activities, there is no foolproof way to
completely eliminate money laundering or the financing of terrorism.
""Moving forward,we have to learn from what is not working and continuously
intensify the anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing regime to
surmount the challenges,"" he added.
In the case of Malaysia, Azman said the financial capital market landscape
is well supported by a comprehensive regulatory and legal framework which goes
beyond criminalising and penalising money laundering and terrorism financing
activities.
He highlighted that local financial institutions in particular are committed
to complying with the requirements of the country's Anti-Money Laundering and
Anti-Terrorism Financing Act 2001 as well as the guidelines laid down by Bank
Negara Malaysia (BNM).
He also said the industry players assist and work closely with the
relevant enforcement agencies and the Financial Intelligence Unit in BNM as the
Competent Authority in investigating cases of money laundering and financial
crime.
As for the IBBM, he said the institute is mindful that all categories of
financial institution staff need continuous training in the application of the
relevant laws and preventive measures pertaining to anti-money laundering and
financial crime.
""This is necessary as they need to be updated with the changing anti-money
laundering and counter terrorism financing trends and developments as well as
to comply with new legislation and guidelines,"" he said.
He said the IBBM had established the Risk Managers Networking Group in 2000
and the Compliance Officers Networking Group in 2001 to further share the
knowledge and experience in their respective operational areas. -- BERNAMA

"GOVT TO ROLL OUT THREE-YEAR PLAN TO COMBAT MONEY LAUNDERING, TERRORISM FINANCING
ZAMANI-AML
KUALA LUMPUR, July 19 (Bernama) -- The government will roll out a three-year
National Anti-Money Laundering/Counter Terrorism Financing (AML/CFT) Strategic
Plan (2010-2012) soon.
Bank Negara Malaysia Deputy Governor Datuk Zamani Abdul Ghani said this
strategic approach was being undertaken to support the country's National Key
Result Areas (KNRAs), particularly the first and second NKRAs aimed at reducing
crime and combating corruption.
""The strategic plan would include a set of strategies to achieve specific
desired outcomes in four key areas involving a focused implementation;
enhancement of the legal framework; improvement of the institutional framework;
and capacity building,"" he said at the International Financial Crime and
Terrorism Financing Conference 2010 here today.
He said the plan would not only cover preventive measures for financial
institutions and designated non-financial businesses and professions, but would
also involve legal, financial intelligence and law enforcement as well as
domestic and international cooperation.
Its implementation which involves the central bank and relevant agencies had
actually started in stages, he added.
Zamani also said Bank Negara would continue to carry out thematic
examination on AML/CFT compliance of the financial institutions when the need
arises, while non-compliance incidences would be dealt with based on the
seriousness of the issue.
He said Malaysia would be involved, under the umbrella of the Asia Pacific
Group (APG) and jointly with the Financial Action Task Force, in particular to
look at best practices to ensure that implementation of the AML/CFT measures
would not be a barrier to financial inclusion.
In Malaysia, the subject of financial inclusion is actually embedded in the
national agenda and implemented with full participation of the financial sector.
Zamani said it was very important for the country to come out with such a
strategic plan and to be well prepared for the next round of evaluation. The
evalution on Malaysia by APG is expected to be in 2012.
""I wish to call upon all stakeholders of our AML/CFT regime at every level
to make due preparation for the coming assessment on Malaysia, while continuing
our concerted efforts in preventing for the interest of the country against
money laundering and terrorism financing risks,"" he said.
He added that the result of the assessment would truly reflect the country's
commitment in not only meeting international standards but also in achieving the
desired results in combating money laundering and terrorism financing.

"94 MONEY LAUNDERING CASES AT VARIOUS STAGES OF PROSECUTION
BNM-MONEY
KUALA LUMPUR, July 19 (Bernama) -- Ninety-four money laundering cases are in
various stages of prosecution with more than 3,000 charges involving proceeds
amounting to RM1.2 billion, said Bank Negara Malaysia Deputy Governor Datuk
Zamani Abdul Ghani.
Zamani, who is also Chairman of the National Coordination Committee to
Counter Money Laundering (NCC), said that law enforcement agencies have
stepped up capacity and efforts to curb laundering of illegal proceeds.
He said the Royal Malaysian Police, the Malaysian Anti Corruption Commission
and the Royal Customs Malaysia have established dedicated anti money
laundering/counter financing terrorism units to give focus to money laundering
and terrorism financing investigations.
""Other related enforcement agencies have also geared up to achieve the same
progress,"" he said in his keynote address at the International Financial Crime
and Terrorism Financing Conferenec 2010, here today.
Zamani said concerted efforts by law enforcement agencies have resulted in
an average annual increase of 86 per cent in anti-money laundering/counter
financing terrorism cases under prosecution and forfeiture without prosecution.
He said the financial system in Malaysia was consistent with the global
trend and was one of the preferred modes of channeling proceeds of crime.
Zamani said it was observed from recent years that a combination of three
common methods were being used to carry out money-laundering activities.
The first is the increased use of repository accounts whereby immediate
withdrawals are made once deposits have been received.
The other two methods consist of fast movement of money across borders and
the involvement of third parties in laundering activities.
""While this is not peculiar to Malaysia, financial institutions are advised
to ensure strong controls are in place to deter and detect these activities,"" he
said.
Zamani said the modus operandi of such methods involved the smuggling of
dirty monies into Malaysia by the agents of a criminal ring, where the agents
would subsequently deposit cash into the accounts of various entities and
individuals in several bank branches operating in border towns.
The deposits will remain in the accounts only for a limited period of time,
where the runners or the agents will withdraw the cash to be further
wire-transferred and or smuggled to another neighbouring country, as instructed
by the syndicates.
The two-day conference themed ""Strengthening Governance to Derive Value"" is
jointly organised by the Institute of Bankers Malaysia and Compliance Officers
Networking Group Malaysia.
About 550 participants from 14 countries are attending the conference.

"INTEGRATED APPROACH A CLEAR NECESSITY TO COMBAT FRAUD, MONEY LAUNDERING
FINANCIAL CRIME-APPROACH
KUALA LUMPUR, July 19 (Bernama) -- A more integrated approach to effectively
combat financial crimes is a clear necessity for enterprises, given the growing
complexity of fraud and money laundering schemes, says an expert.
Karen Van Ness, Senior Manager for Financial Crime and Compliance Solutions,
Product Management at Oracle Mantas, said a better integrated financial crime
and compliance management to anti-money laundering (AML) and fraud prevention
would enable enterprises to understand the full impact of financial crime on the
institutions.
Oracle Mantas is part of Oracle Financial Services Software Inc.
She said the silo'd approach to financial crime management results in
exposure whereby most firms rely heavily on point solutions to fight crime.
""An integrated approach creates an extra ""layer"" to review high-risk
customers, channels and products, and helps you better understand how anti-fraud
and AML efforts apply to the totality of the institutions operational risk
assessment.
""It urgrades systems, streamline processes and improve efficiencies,"" she
told reporters after speaking on ""An Integrated Approach to Fighting Financial
Crime: Leveraging Investments in AML and Fraud Solutions"" at the 2nd
International Financial Crime and Terrorism Financing Conference 2010 today.
Ness said the integrated approach also improved return on risknd compliance
investments whereby by centralising compliance and fraud analytical teams can
provide synergies, cost savings and efficiencies.
""Financial crime costs an estimated US$20 billion in losses annually, and
the operational costs of compliance are growing substantially year after year.
""That's why the need to limit losses and reduce costs of compliance is a
matter of urgent concern for the financial services industry,"" she said.
Ness said adopting an integrated approach also enhances institutional
reputation and cultivate customer trust.
Financial crime management needs the holistic approach as increased speed
and technology demand with sophistication of fraudsters create special
challenges, she said.
A centralised monitoring approach facilitates easier hand-off alerts, cases
and investigations as well as greater sharing of leads and information between
AML and fraud teams.
It also supports load balancing across teams to meet the changing
business/regulatory needs.
Touching on Malaysian context, Ness said although fighting financial
crime was relatively a new paradigm, enterprises are taking it very seriously
rather than seeing it as a government mandate.

trying to make Southeast Asia the centre for their money laundering
activities.
Senior Supt Lucas Vera, deeputy executive director of the Philippine
Centre of Transnational Crimes, said these groups were taking advantage of
the economic crisis in the region.
""They make the best use of financial institutions here as the hard hit
developing countries in Asean are hungry for investors and cash,"" he told

Taking part in the three-day meeting are 38 officers from Australia,

India, Pakistan, Singapore, Vietnam and Thailand as well as Interpol.
Vera said the authorities were aware that organised criminal groups
were also using communication technology to carry out their illicit
activities.
It is learnt that crime syndicates clean their dirty money by using
offshore financial havens and cash-only businesses, and abuse of certain
financial services offered by banks and other deposit-taking institutions.
Emerging markets such as insurance and money changing sectors are also
increasingly becoming the venue for large scale money laundering.
Vera did not rule out the possibility that local groups were
collaborating with international criminals in the lucrative business.
""Their method is to transport a huge amount of US dollars and
counterfeits in to a country and with the locals' help, they change it to

MONEY LAUNDERING-LABUAN
LABUAN, Oct 20 (Bernama) -- International co-operation is a
pre-requisite to effectively fight against transnational organised crime,
including money laundering, said Deputy Finance Minister Datuk Dr Shafie
Mohamad Salleh today.
As such, he said the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean)
had established the Asean plan of action to combat transnational crime for
the benefit of member countries.
The plan included the exchange of information, legal and administrative
assistance among Asean member countries wherever feasible, he said when
opening a money laundering and financial fraud conference here.
""Financial crime is a global contagion and that's why we need
international co-operation to address the problem,"" he said.
On money-laundering, Shafie said measures to create knowledge and
awareness to counteract it were essential and vital, and ""it is still
lacking among the global financial community, including the Labuan Offshore
Financial Centre (IOFC).
However, with the strong support by Labuan Offshore Financial Services
IOFC would be ready and willing to undertake the necessary steps to curb
this threat to national and global financial systems.
Shafie said the development of Information and Communications
Technology (ICT) had provided opportunities for criminal groups or
individuals to speed up the processes of money laundering.
""The ultimate objective of any money launderer is to achieve personal
gain without detection and to this end, money launderers will exploit
countries or jurisdictions with the weakest counter measures and
enforcement against money laundering.
""Money launderers will transfer their networks from country to country,
layering their financial transactions through different jurisdictions to
undertake money laundering activities,"" he said.
In this regard, Shafie said various measures to curb financial crimes
in Labuan IOFC were reflected in the existing offshore legislation.
These efforts included a mutual evaluation on Labuan IOFC by the
Asia-Pacific Group on Money Laundering and the Offshore Group of Banking
Supervisors in May 2001.
Labuan IOFC, he said, had been deemed to be a low-risk jurisdiction for

granted a discharge not amounting to an aquittal to Datuk V. Alexander
Chako who faced three charges under the Anti-Money Laundering Act 2001
involving RM10 million.
Judge Akhtar Tahir held that the charges against Chako were defective
because they did not clearly state the actual offence committed.
""The court is responsible in ensuring that a charge is made correctly
by the public prosecutor and complies with the Criminal Procedure Code
(CPC).
""In this case, the alleged illegal activity was not specifically stated
in the charge sheet, rendering the charges against the accused defective
under the law,"" he said.
He made the decision after hearing and carefully examining Deputy
Public Prosecutor Dzulkifli Ahmad and defence counsel K. Kumaraendran's
argument pertaining to the matter last April 12.
Judge Akhtar said the public prosecutor had failed to meet the
requirement of Section 154 of the CPC which states the details of how an
offence which was committed need to be spelt out in the charge.
However, the form of the charges and the details as to the time, place
and parties involved, as stipulated under Sections 152 and 153 of the CPC,
had been followed by the public prosecutor, he said.
""After the court makes this decision, it is up to the public prosecutor
to amend the charge sheet. If they wish to continue with the existing
charge, the court will grant the accused a discharge not amounting to an
acquittal,"" he said.
Dzulkifli stood up and told the court that the prosecution would

The court then granted Chako a discharge not amounting to an acquittal
under Section 173(g) of the CPC.
Dzulkifli told reporters later that this case was the first under the

Alliance Bhd between Oct 19 and Dec 27, 2004.
In the third charge, he was alleged to have received RM10 million from the
illegal activity via an account with RHB Bank Berhad at Boulevard in Mid-Valley

They were charged under Section 4(1) of the Anti-Money Laundering Act 2001

Justice Jagjit Singh said the prosecution had also failed to ascertain

Zamani, who is also Chairman of the National Coordination Committee to
Counter Money Laundering (NCC), said that law enforcement agencies have
stepped up capacity and efforts to curb laundering of illegal proceeds.
He said the Royal Malaysian Police, the Malaysian Anti Corruption Commission
and the Royal Customs Malaysia have established dedicated anti money
laundering/counter financing terrorism units to give focus to money laundering
and terrorism financing investigations.
""Other related enforcement agencies have also geared up to achieve the same
progress,"" he said in his keynote address at the International Financial Crime
and Terrorism Financing Conferenec 2010, here today.
Zamani said concerted efforts by law enforcement agencies have resulted in
an average annual increase of 86 per cent in anti-money laundering/counter
financing terrorism cases under prosecution and forfeiture without prosecution.
He said the financial system in Malaysia was consistent with the global
trend and was one of the preferred modes of channeling proceeds of crime.
Zamani said it was observed from recent years that a combination of three
common methods were being used to carry out money-laundering activities.
The first is the increased use of repository accounts whereby immediate
withdrawals are made once deposits have been received.
The other two methods consist of fast movement of money across borders and
the involvement of third parties in laundering activities.
""While this is not peculiar to Malaysia, financial institutions are advised
to ensure strong controls are in place to deter and detect these activities,"" he
said.
Zamani said the modus operandi of such methods involved the smuggling of
dirty monies into Malaysia by the agents of a criminal ring, where the agents
would subsequently deposit cash into the accounts of various entities and
individuals in several bank branches operating in border towns.
The deposits will remain in the accounts only for a limited period of time,
where the runners or the agents will withdraw the cash to be further
wire-transferred and or smuggled to another neighbouring country, as instructed
by the syndicates.
The two-day conference themed ""Strengthening Governance to Derive Value"" is
jointly organised by the Institute of Bankers Malaysia and Compliance Officers
Networking Group Malaysia.
About 550 participants from 14 countries are attending the conference.

DEVELOPER, EX-MIC YOUTH TREASURER AGAIN FREED OF MONEY-LAUNDERING
COURT-LAUNDERING
KUALA LUMPUR, July 21 (Bernama) -- Charges of money laundering amounting to
RM10 million brought against developer Datuk V. Alexander Chako and former MIC
Youth treasurer S. Ganesan were again thrown out by the Sessions Court.
They were today acquitted and discharged by Justice Jagjit Singh who found
the charges defective and contrary to Section 152 of the Criminal Procedure
Code.
The judge ruled that the prosecution failed to prove a prima facie case
against the accused and the charges were not spelt out for them to defend
themselves fairly and effectively.
Chako, 49 and Ganesan, 34, claimed trial when they were first charged in
2006 under the Anti-Money Laundering Act 2001 but the case was dismissed by
another Sessions Court judge, Datuk Akhtar Tahir, over the manner the charges
were drafted.
But they were charged again with the same offences after a prosecution
appeal to the High Court.
Chako, a director of Triscenic Sdn Bhd, had faced three charges related to a
land deal in Kuala Lumpur.
He was accused of money laundering over the land deal in a law firm in
Bangsar between Sept 14 and Oct 1, 2004 and faced a second charge of using the
land as security to obtain a RM10.5 million loan from Malaysian Assurance
Alliance Bhd between Oct 19 and Dec 27, 2004.
In the third charge, he was alleged to have received RM10 million from the
illegal activity via an account with RHB Bank Berhad at Boulevard in Mid-Valley
between Sept 29, 2004 and March 1, 2005.
Ganesan of Taman Sri Sinar, Segambut, faced two charges of accepting two
cheques from the illegal activities amounting to RM400,000 at the same bank
between Feb 8 and Feb 24, 2005.
They were charged under Section 4(1) of the Anti-Money Laundering Act 2001
and faced up to five years jail or fine up to RM5 million upon conviction.
Justice Jagjit Singh said the prosecution had also failed to ascertain
whether the land and the sums of RM10 million and RM400,000 were proceeds from
an unlawful activity.
He said that after considering the factual circumstances, he was satisfied
that Chako had no knowledge or reason to believe that the land and the RM10
million loan were illegal proceeds.
Neither had the prosecution showed what steps Ganesan had failed to take to
ascertain that the RM400,000 was from an unlawful activity, he said.

"BNM TO BE VIGILANT TO EVOLVING ANTI MONEY LAUNDERING
REPORT-AML
KUALA LUMPUR, March 22 (Bernama) -- Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) will
continue to be vigilant and respond to evolving Anti Money Laundering and
Counter Financing Terrosim (AML/CFT) threats.
The central bank will also response to AML/CFT standards and trends by
fine tuning its legal and regulatory measures, including the invocation of
the Anti Money Laundering Act 2001 (AMLA) reporting obligation on other
categories of financial and non-financial businesses and professions as
recommended by the Financial Task Force on Money Laundering's 40+9 (FATF).
The year ahead is expected to be very challenging for Malaysia as it is
scheduled for a second round of Mutual Evaluation jointly by the
Asia/Pacific Group (APG) for Money Laundering Group and the Offshore Group
of the Banking Supervisors (OGBS) in early 2007, BNM said in its 2005
Annual Report released today.
It said the OGBS will evaluate the AML/CFT regime of the offshore
sector in the Labuan International Offshore Financial Centre.
The APG evaluation team will assess the effectiveness of Malaysia's
AML/CFT system and its compliance with the FATP's 40+9 recommedations based
on the revised 2004 methodology for assessment, the central bank said.
To carry out this massive and important exercise, various working
groups have been established under the National Co-ordination Committee to
Counter Money Laundering (NCC) to focus on all the 250 assessment criteria.
BNM said Malaysia's current AML/CFT measures, laws, regulations,
guidelines and framework are being reviewed to identify gaps and and to
formulate rectification measures.
The central bank also said that at the international front, Malaysia
achieved distinction of being selected at the Eight APG Annual Meeting as
the representative for the Southeast Asia region in the APG Steering Group
for a period from July 2005 till July 2006.
Among the roles of the steering group are to provide advice on issues

"NEED TO FACILITATE COMPLIANCE IN EFFORTS TO COMBAT MONEY LAUNDERING
DAIM-MONEY LAUNDERING
KUALA LUMPUR, May 22 (Bernama) -- As the international community sets
out to combat money laundering, the focus should be on the provision of
on-going technical assistance and training to facilitate compliance rather
than the so-called inadequate observance of international standards, said
Finance Minister Tun Daim Zainuddin.
""Such constructive and developmental approach would be fairer and would
yield more positive results,"" he said in his keynote address at the
three-day Asia-Pacific Group (APG) on Money Laundering's 4th annual meeting
here today.
Admittedly, he said, Malaysia faces constraints and limitations in
dealing with the complex and global nature of money laundering but its
membership of the APG since May 31, 2000 has enabled it to particpate in
the mutual evaluation programmes.
Malaysia too has responded to the call of the international community
by expediting the enactment of the Anti-Money Laundering Act 2001.
The Malaysian Parliament passed the Act earlier this month, with 119
serious offences including drug trafficking, corruption, kidnapping,
robbery and human trafficking.
Daim said the Anti-Money Laundering Act 2001 is the first law in
Malaysia that provides for multi-agency enforcement.
""The new law contains the investigative powers that are ordinarily
given to investigation officers (IOs). The enforcement agency having the
powers to enforce the laws under which the (stated) offence is committed is
given the power to investigate the related money-laundering offence,"" he
added.
As such, he said the next stage in implementing the new law is crucial
in testing the efficiency of the legal provisions of the Act but the
government would remain vigilant and continue to improve further on its
anti-money laundering efforts.
Meanhwile, a coordinated national effort to fight against money
laundering was realised by setting up the National Co-ordination Committee
(NCC) to Counter Money Laundering,involving 13 ministries and government
agencies as its members.
The NCC is responsible for developing a national policy and measures to
counter money laundering and it co-ordinates Malaysia's responses to
international initiatives against money laundering.
Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) governor Datuk Dr Zeti Akhtar Aziz in her
welcoming speech said the central bank, being the lead agency of the NCC,
is committed to ensure that the integrity of the Malaysian financial system
is not in any way compromised by these types of criminal activities.
Among others, it had introduced a number of initiatives to counter
money laundering, including ""Know Your Customer"" guidelines issued in 1989
and revised in 1993 which will help prevent banking institutions from being
used as a conduit for money laundering.
She said money launderers are quick to probe the financial system for
vulnerabilities and use their ingenuity to devise new methods to circumvent
the system and adapt their methods to exploit these vulnerabilities.
""It is, therefore, imperative that the banking industry be vigilant to
ensure that all efforts of the money launderer are thwarted,"" she added.
In her speech, she noted that offshore financial centres have been the
focus of the international community as being vulnerable to being abused by
money launderers.
She added that the Labuan Offshore Financial Services Authority
(LOFSA), being an NCC member would continue to promote the image of
Labuan's IOFC as a well-regulated and clean centre.
To demonstrate Labuan's commitement in fighting money-laundering
activities, Labuan had volunteered to be assessed by APG.
The evaluation team comprising evaluators from the APG and the Offshore
Group of Banking Supervisors (OGBS) has met with the respective ministries
and government agencies and the Labuan offshore players and the report will
be tabled accordingly, she said. -- BERNAMA

million in cash between Australia and Asia.
Hang Thanh Huynh, her brother, Phat Ba Huynh, and a third man, Tam Tran were
part of an international syndicate which allegedly laundered A$93 million, the
Australian Associated Press reports.
Hang, 38, once described by police as ""one of the most significant money

syndicate to deal with more than A$1 million, which she believed was the
proceeds of crime.
Phat, 35, and Tam, 46, pleaded guilty to receiving, possessing or disposing of
more than A$1 million, knowing the money was the proceeds of the crime.
The police had previously noted the syndicate laundered money through
electronic transfers involving Melbourne, Sydney, Vietnam and other Asian
countries.
The Huynhs, from the suburb of Sunshine in Melbourne's west, worked at the
Long Thanh Money Transfer in Footscray when the offences were committed, police
told a previous court hearing.
The siblings used that business and another in Sydney to transfer money for
organised crime syndicates.
Other members of the syndicate used commercial airlines to smuggle the money
out of Australia, it has been alleged.
The court heard Hung and Tam, of Earlwood in Sydney's southwest, were part
of the syndicate between December 2005 and October 2006.
Phat was involved in the crime between May 2006 and October 2006.
The trio was bailed on strict conditions to appear in the Victorian County

"GOVT TO TABLE MONEY LAUNDERING BILL NEXT YEAR
LABUAN-BILL
LABUAN, Nov 23 (Bernama) - The government will table a Money Laundering
Bill for the Labuan International Offshore Centre (IOFC) sometime next
year, said Finance Minister Tun Daim Zainuddin.
He, however, did not specify when the bill will be tabled.
At a press conference after a keynote address at the Annual Labuan
Lecture Series 2000 and launch of the Labuan International Financial
Exchange (LFX) here today, he said that a draft of the Act was already in
place.
He indicated that the Money Laundering Act would be different from the
domestic money laundering legislation, which is currently being enforced.
Labuan's Money Laundering Act will be suited for offshore industries,
he added.
Daim said that although there were no money laundering activities
uncovered in Labuan thus far, the Money Laundering Act would, be
implemented as a preventive measure.
Commenting on LFX, Daim said the new financial exchange, being the
first and the only offshore financial exchange in Asia, will be
complementary and synergistic to the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) and
the Malaysian Exchange of Securities Dealing and Quotation (Mesdaq).
Daim also expects large Malaysian companies such as Kumpulan Guthrie
Bhd, Sime Darby Bhd and Tanjong plc, which are listed on the London Stock
Exchange, to be part of the list on LFX.
The government encourages this multinational companies, be it local or
foreign, to issue Islamic global trust certificates to help kick-start the
market and serve as a benchmark for future global issues.
In the meantime, Labuan will enviously preserve its image as a credible
and reputable offshore financial centre in achieving standards that enable
it to withstand the most intense of scrutiny.
On the capital expenditure spent on Labuan for development, Daim said,
RM2.0 billion has been spent in the past 10 years and this commitment will
continue.
He, however, did not state the amount of money to be committed by the
government in the next five years.
To a question, director general of Lofsa, Mohd Razif Abdul Kadir, said
that Lofsa would not spend time worrying about competition due to the
countless offshore financial centres that have existed and more that will
be created.
He noted that there are already other offshore financial centres in the
world, such as Bahrain, London and New York.
In fact, offshore financial centres co-exist and complement each other,
he added.
""Competition cannot be avoided when numbers are depended upon to create
liquidity. Instead of worrying, Lofsa will focus on innovation in coming
out with products and efficiency enhancements,"" he said.
When asked to comment at the press conference, the executive chairman
of KLSE, Datuk Mohd Azlan Hashim, said there will be no dual listing
allowed, meaning companies listed on the KLSE cannot have a listing on LFX
and vice versa.
The prohibition, however, will not apply on dual listings by companies
traded in other foreign financial exchanges, he added.
LFX and the KLSE will be two separate jurisdictions regulated by two
distinct laws and framework, he said.
On whether the dual listing prohibition will also be applied between
LFX and Mesdaq, he said, nothing has been decided in that respect as there
was no arrangement between the two exchanges so far.
LFX facilitates the listing of a wide spectrum of financial instruments
including equities, investment funds, debt instruments, insurance related
instruments and other types of financial instruments that can be issued
based on the requirement and demand of issuers and investors.
The instruments listed can be based on either conventional or Islamic
principles, denominated in US dollars. -- BERNAMA

vital in the detection of suspicious transactions, particularly money
laundering, said Deputy Governor of Bank Negara Malaysa Datuk Zamani Abdul

In this respect, he said, onshore and offshore financial institutions
should play a key role in preserving the integrity of the financial

Zamani said this when opening an anti-money laundering seminar and
workshop, ""The Imperative for Offshore Financial Institutions"", here,

He said the cooperation and vigilance of all categories of staff were
important to ensure the success of the compliance programme.
""They must be empowered to take action when they come across suspicious
or unusual customer transactions,"" he said.
Zamani also suggested that staff of financial institutions undergo
learning and training covering basic knowledge of human behaviour and
behaviour analysis as well as the Anti-Money Laundering Act (AMLA).
""Such knowledge will be of particular benefit to front-line staff who

mutating the nature of their money laundering activities, and as such,
regulators should keep layering on new laws and recommendation to keep
pace.
""The damage to a financial institution arising from it being used by
money launderers is not limited to its reputation only. The criminals may
infiltrate the institution and breed other undesirable activities,"" he
said.
Therefore, he said, Bank Negara Malaysia conducted rigorous vetting

"TWO BROKERS GET FIVE YEARS' JAIL, FINED RM1 MLN EACH FOR MONEY LAUNDERING
COURT-LAUNDERING
KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 23 (Bernama) -- Two unlicensed land brokers were each
sentenced to five years' jail and fined RM1 million by the Sessions Court here
today for money laundering activities involving over RM4 million.
Judge Datuk Jagjit Singh made the decision after ruling that the defence for
both accused failed to raise a reasonable doubt against the prosecution's case
that the accused received the proceeds from the illegal activities.
The first accused, Gan Kiat Bend, 52, faced four charges of money laundering
involving a total of RM2.4 million. He was alleged to have committed the offence
at Standard Chartered Bank Malaysia Berhad, No 2, Jalan Ampang, here between Nov
19, 2003 and Jan 9, 2004.
The second accused, Ismail Husin, 59, was charged with 12 counts of money
laundering involving RM2.85 million. He was alleged to have committed the
offence at the same place and time.
According to the facts of the case, Gan and a number of people were involved
in the sale and purchase of land and falsifying of land ownership, with the
proceeds paid to him and Ismail.
Jagjit sentenced Gan to five years' jail and fined him RM1 million, or one
year's jail on the first charge, two years on the second and fourth charge, and
six months on the third, if he fails to pay the fine.
Ismail was sentenced to one year's jail on the first and 11th charge, six
months on the second, third, 5th, 6th and 7th, two years on the 4th, 18 months
on the 8th, five years on the 9th and 10th plus RM500,000 fine on each of these
two charges or six months' jail for failure to pay the fines, and three months
on the 12th charge.
Jagjit ordered the jail terms, sentenced under Section 4(1) of the
Anti-Money Laundering Act 2001, to run concurrently from today.
However, the judge allowed a stay of execution pending their appeals to the
High Court.
Jagjit also ordered Gan to pay RM2.4 million and Ismail, RM2.6 million, as
panelty or levy for the laundered money involved, under Section 283 of the
Criminal Procedure Code. Failing to pay this panelty within a year will land
them with another jail term.
In passing sentence, the judge said he took into consideration public
interest as the offence was serious because it involved falsifying of land
ownership, while the amount was big and the money was not returned to the
victims.

"BNM TO JOIN HANDS WITH OTHERS TO FIGHT MONEY LAUNDERING
REPORT-LAUNDERING
KUALA LUMPUR, March 26 (Bernama) -- With money laundering regarded as a
multi-jurisdictional crime, Bank Negara Malaysia says it will join hands
with monetary authorities in other countries to share financial
intelligence to effectively combat the menace and the financing of
terrorism.
Bank Negara Governor Tan Sri Dr Zeti Akhtar Aziz said in the central
bank's 2003 annual report released here today that the Anti-Money
Laundering Act 2001 (AMLA) among other things, aims to protect the national
economy from being tainted with such illegal proceeds.
The provisions of the AMLA, which was gazetted as law in July 2001,
ensures the safety and soundness of the financial system to protect the
financial sector from being abused for money laundering activities, she
said.
Following Sept 11, the national anti-money laundering programme was
extended to include the fight against terrorism, with particular emphasis
on terrorist financing.
The report states that ""any person funding terrorists is deemed to be
abetting the terrorists and commits an offence under the penal code.""
""Those receiving the funds also commit money laundering offences for
dealing with proceeds with illegal activities,"" it said.
As part of the on-going efforts to build capacity in the fight against
the menace, Dr Zeti said that Malaysia would host an Anti-Money Laundering
seminar in July 2003 for Asean members as well as co-host an international
seminar on money laundering with Germany in October 2003.
Also, in efforts towards enhancing international co-operation, she said
Malaysia has applied for membership in the Egmont Group of Financial

This body, consisting of financial intelligence units from 69
jurisdictions, aims to provide a forum for financial intelligence units to
expand and systemise the exchange of financial intelligence as well as the
sharing of expertise and capabilities.
Dr Zeti said with the coming into force of AMLA, the supervisory role
of the central bank was strengthened further to ensure that financial
institutions were able to fully comply with the requirements of the Act.
Financial institutions are required to ascertain that they have
sufficient controls in place to prevent their institutions from being

"BNM CONTINUES TO COMBAT MONEY LAUNDERING & TERRORISM FINANCING
REPORT-MONEY
KUALA LUMPUR, March 26 (Bernama) -- Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) will
continue its leadership role in the fight against money laundering
activities as well as terrorism financing, the central bank said in its
2003 Annual Report released today.
BNM said money laundering trends constantly evolved and hence they
necessitated the continuous training of law enforcement personnel to
upgrade their knowledge and skills.
The central bank said the global community ""continues to intensify
efforts to enhance measures to detect and deter money laundering and
terrorism financing.""
""There has been greater co-operation among national agencies to put in
place the appropriate statues and continue to build capacity of personnel
involved in implementing the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Financing of
Terrorism (AML/CFT) programme initiatives,"" it said.
BNM also leads various law enforcement agencies in combating money
laundering and terrorism financing. For instance, it is the secretariat to
the National Co-ordination Committee to Counter Money Laundering (NCC),
which was established in 2000 to formulate AML/CFT measures, co-ordinate
the implementation of these measures and to ensure that the national
efforts are aligned with regional and international initiatives.
""Malaysia is committed to criminalise the financing of terrorism as
called for under the UN International for the Suppression of the Financing
of Terrorism,"" the central bank said.
BNM said Malaysia had proposed to accede to the UN Convention by making
appropriate amendments to and provide new legislative provisions in, five
pieces of legislation, namely the Penal Code, Criminal Procedure Code,
Subordinate Courts Act 1948, Court of Judicature Act 1964 and the
Anti-Money Laundering Act 2001 (AMLA).
Parliament passed the Anti Money Laundering (Amendment) Act 2003 in
November 2003 and was gazetted as law on Dec 25, 2003.
""When this legislation is brought into force by a ministerial order,
the short title of AMLA would be changed to Anti-Money Laundering and
Anti-Terrorism Financing Act 2001,"" it explained.
The amending legislation extends BNM's money laundering reporting
mechanism to include the reporting of suspected terrorism financing,
provides for measures to be taken for the detection and prevention of
terrorism financing as well as provides for the freeze, seizure and
forfeiture of terrorist property.
The money laundering reporting mechanism under AMLA covers financial
institutions and certain categories of non-financial institutions, which
are considered to be of higher risk to money laundering or terrorist
financing activities.
""Our implementation approach of extending the reach of the law
incrementally ensures that the reporting institutions are well prepared and
able to effectively comply with their obligations under AMLA,"" BNM said.
Since AMLA came into force on Jan 15, 2002, the requirement to report
suspicious transaction was invoked on banking and Islamic banking
institutions, insurance companies and Takaful operators, money changers and
offshore entities.
In 2003, several other categories of businesses had been included as
reporting institutions under AMLA to a total of 973, and they included Bank
Kerjasama Rakyat Malaysia, Bank Simpanan Nasional, Lembaga Tabung Haji, Pos
Malaysia Bhd and Genting Casino.
In 2003, the number of money laundering predicate offences increased to
150 from 122 serious crimes from 23 pieces of legislation. -- BERNAMA

"BANK NEGARA TO FURTHER CURB MONEY LAUNDERING ACTIVITIES
REPORT-LAUNDERING
KUALA LUMPUR, March 26 (Bernama) -- Bank Negara Malaysia today said that it
will remain vigilant to evolving money laundering and terrorism
financing threats in the country.
Together with the National Co-ordination Committee to Counter Money
Laundering (NCC), it has come up with several measures including tightening the
use of informal channels of money transfer and encouraging the use of formal
channels such as banks to counter the problem.
Money laundering and terrorism financing typologies have indicated ongoing
threats in high cash concentrated activities such as casinos, cash couriers, as
well as informal remittance systems, said the central bank in its 2007 Annual
Report, which was released here today.
In this regard, among others, the NCC has established a task force on cross
border transportation of currency and bearer negotiable instruments to address
the only ""non-compliant"" rating against the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)
Special Recommendation IX on Cash Couriers.
The task force, which consists of Bank Negara Malaysia, the Royal Malaysian
Customs, Ministry of Home Affairs and Immigration Department, will be making
recommendations on appropriate regulatory and enforcement measures to prevent
as well as to detect cash couriers moving funds illegally for criminal
activity, it said.
To mitigate the potential risk of criminal abuse from the prevalent use of
alternative and informal remittance services provided through moneychangers,
these businesses would be subject to more stringent supervisory measures, while
the use of formal remittance channels such as banking institutions and licensed
non-bank remittance operators will be further encouraged, it said.
Bank Negara said the effective compliance monitoring of designated
non-financial businesses and professions (DNFBPs) remains a challenge due to
the sheer number of these entities.
There are approximately over 30,000 DNFBPs nationwide established either as
sole proprietorships, partnerships or limited liability companies, it said.
The central bank said it would continue to promote a more active role on
the part of the self-regulatory organisation (SRO) or the trade bodies to ensure
the compliance of DNFBPs with legal and regulatory Anti-Money
Laundering/Counter Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) requirements.
This will be supplemented with the development of a comprehensive
risk-based compliance framework that appropriately reflects the unique
characteristics of this sector, it said.
As financial institutions strengthen their internal AML/CFT programmes in
line with the more stringent regulatory measures and international standards,
it can be expected that perpetrators of illegal activities will seek
alternative channels to further financial crimes.
There is therefore a need to ensure on a continuous basis that the AML/CFT
supervisory framework remains comprehensive in terms of reporting institutions
covered and the effective enforcement of the AML/CFT measures, said the report.
The challenge is, however, to ensure that the costs associated with
increased regulatory and compliance measures are also balanced with the money
laundering and tourism financing risk.
To this end, Bank Negara and the NCC will continue to work with the
relevant business communities in instituting appropriate AML/CFT measures that are
commensurate with the size, complexity and risk exposure of the reporting
institutions. - BERNAMA

KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 26 (Bernama) -- The Asia Pacific countries must
cooperate to come up with a law on money laundering to effectively curb
such activity by drug traffickers, Deputy Home Minister Datuk Tajol Rosli
Ghazali said today.
He said it was pointless for a country to have laws enabling the
seizure of the assets of drug traffickers if the other countries have no
such law.
""Malaysia has laws to provide for the seizure of assets (of convicted
drug traffickers) but the other countries don't. Cooperation from countries
in Asia and the Pacific is needed for it to operate more effectively,"" he
said.
He was speaking to reporters after opening the 22nd Meeting of Heads of
National Law Enforcement Agencies, Asia and the Pacific (Honlea).
Tajol Rosli said drug traffickers in Malaysia were suspected to have
assets amounting to RM22 million last year but only RM1.5 million was
seized.
""This is a very small sum and the cooperation of all parties is needed
to ensure that it (money laundering) does not occur,"" he said.
Earlier, in his speech, Tajol Rosli said Malaysia was ready to
cooperate with other countries to trace, freeze and confiscate the assets
of drug traffickers.
He said extraordinary measures are needed to combat drug trafficking
activities as they were conducted with the utmost secrecy and were
well-organised, unlike other criminal activities.
Tajol Rosli said Malaysia had taken steps to ensure that the banking
system could not be used by drug traffickers.
Bank Negara had established a multi-discipline working group to counter
money laundering within the banking and other financial and non-financial
sectors.
The Central Bank also promoted public awareness on money laundering and
its counter measures, he said.
The five-day meeting attended by 58 countries and 13 international
organisations is aimed at stepping up efforts to control and prevent drug
trafficking in the Asia Pacific and enhancing cooperation among enforcement
agencies.

However, domestic consumption and trafficking of many types of illicit

The report says US goals for the coming year include continuing to
encourage the Malaysian government to enact legislative measures such as a

strengthen Malaysia's counter-narcotics efforts.
The Clinton administration also wants to continue to expand successful

"INDIA FOR STRINGENT LAWS TO CHECK MONEY LAUNDERING
NEW DELHI, Oct 27 (Bernama-Pti) -- Mere possession of very large sums
of money should in itself be considered suspect by investigating agencies
probing money laundering cases in India, officials suggested at the recent
Interpol conference here.
The suggestion came in context of glaring fact that a whopping amount
of money was laundered globally in drug trafficking.
The Interpol Secretary General Raymonds E.Kendall, had disclosed that
much over 500 billion U.S. dollars (about RM1.6 trillion) was illegally
transcted each year globally on illicit drug trade alone.
The 66th annual general assembly of the Interpol, which held a special
session on money laundering, adopted three major resolutions - calling upon
nations to frame stringent laws to check the menace, seeking international
police cooperation on investigations and exchange of probe-related
information between countries.
At the special session, chaired by CBI Special Director D R
Karthikeyan, the Indian side stressed that laundering of assets derived
from illegal financial activities, including tax fraud, should be declared
a crime and mere possession of very large sums should in itself be
considered suspect.
The Indian side highlighted the problems of tax havens, which made it
possible for large number of criminals to violate all national laws with
impunity and sought better international police cooperation.
The Indian side also stressed that such cooperation was possible even
with countries which had laws on banking secrecy, as they knew from their
recent experiences with Switzerland.
The Interpol has defined money laundering as ""any act or attempt to
conceal or disguise illegally obtained assets so that they appear to have
originated from legitimate sources"".
In the main resolution, the Interpol urged member countries to consider
adoption of stringent laws to provide for criminal prosecution,
confiscation of assets and giving law enforcement agencies the power to
identify, trace, and freeze assets derived from illegal activities.
The resolution also sought making provision for repatriation of such
assets and exchange of such records between member countries.
In line with Australian laws, the resolution urged the governments to
ask banks and financial institutions to report unusual or suspect currency
or other transactions to appropriate authorities who would have powers to
conduct further invesigations.
The governments should also ask these institutions to maintain records
of such transactions for at least five years after their conclusion. --

"DOCTOR FACES ANOTHER MONEY LAUNDERING PROCEEDS CHARGE
Court-Doctor
PETALING JAYA, April 28 (Bernama) -- Doctor Hamimah Idruss, who claimed
trial to seven charges of receiving proceeds from money laundering
activities last Friday, was charged with a similar offence at the Sessions
Court here today.
The 55-year-old claimed trial to being involved in and receiving
proceeds from foreign money laundering activities to the tune of
USD$1,126,607.50 (RM4,275,475.46).
The former director of Syarikat Safire Pharmaceuticals (M) Sdn Bhd had
allegedly received the money via the account of Megbridge Sdn Bhd at the
OCBC Bank (M) Berhad in Jalan SS21/60, Damansara Utama here on June 10,
2003.
She is charged under Section 4(1) of the Anti-Money Laundering Act 2001
which carries a maximum fine of RM5 million or five years' jail or both
upon conviction.
The seven earlier charges of receiving proceeds from money laundering
amounted to more than USD$9 million (RM37 million) and Hamimah was released
on RM800,000 bail in two sureties.
Today, Deputy Public Prosecutor Dzulkifli Ahmad told the court that the
most recent charge was part of the alleged activities of the Taiping-born
accused.
Stating that the Act mirrored the seriousness of the offence, he urged
Sessions Judge Nurmala Salim to set bail at RM200,000 in one surety for the
charge and compel Hamimah to surrender her travel documents to the court.
Hamimah, who was represented by Counsel Shahrul Amali Shafie, asked the
bail to be reduced to RM100,000.
Nurmala set bail at RM150,000 in one surety and set July 2 for mention
of the case.

"MAS ISSUES NEW ALERT AGAINST DRUG MONEY LAUNDERING
SINGAPORE-MAS
SINGAPORE, May 28 (Bernama) -- The Monetary Authority of Singapore
(MAS) has warned merchant banks here to be extra alert against the
laundering of drug money and had issued fresh directives on the matter, the
Straits Times reported.
MAS, the de facto central bank, issued updated guidelines to the 75
merchant banks on Wednesday, which among others, require banks to report
suspicious transactions.
The banks would not be guilty of breaching banking privacy rules for
doing so.
The report said a MAS official denied the fresh guidelines were linked
to an expected arrival next week of investigators from Britain's National
Crime Squad (NCS) to interview victims of a global investment scam.
It was earlier reported that hundreds, perhaps thousands of
Singaporeans, were duped of substantial sums of money by the scam which
offered shares at special low prices.
The case is being probed by the NCS' Money Laundering Investigation
Team in London which would sent officers to interview some victims here
next week. There were also many victims from Hong Kong.
The investigators are trying to prove that a solicitor, magistrate and
accountant arrested in London were laundering suspected Colombian drug
money through the scam.
Detective Constable Martin Woods of the NCS told the Straits Times that
the crux of the matter was that in Singapore and Hong Kong, unlike Britain,
it was ""not illegal to cold call people and sell them shares over the
telephone"" and that was why many Singaporeans were cheated. -- BERNAMA

NEW DELHI, June 28 (Bernama-PTI) - India has called for a uniform
legislation to combat money laundering and asserted that the
confidentiality clause in banking systems should not be invoked when the
probe was against illegal transfer of funds.
This was stated by the four-member Indian delegation headed by K.
Vijaya Rama Rao, director of Central Bureau of Investigaton (CBI), at the
14th Interpol Asian regional conference in Bangkok recently.
Suggesting formation of a study group to define money laundering, Rama
Rao said that issue of confidentiality of the banking system as existing in
various countries should not hinder the progress of investigation.
The CBI director was of the view that a way should be found out to
ensure that investigating agencies, probing such cases, did not suffer
because of the confidentiality clause.
The delegation said that information about illegal transfer of money
was more beneficial at an early stage of probe rather than after protracted

"FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS NEED EFFECTIVE PROGRAMME TO CURB MONEY LAUNDERING
SAS-LAUNDERING
KUALA LUMPUR, July 28 (Bernama) -- Leader in business intelligence, SAS
says the key challenge for local financial institutions is how to implement
a risk-based anti-money laundering (AML) programme that effectively covers
all the new and emerging money laundering techniques.
""At the same time, they need to adequately address the entity's unique
risk profile,"" said Helen Lim, principal financial services, SAS Malaysia,
in a statement today.
Last year, she said an estimated of between US$800 billion and US$2.2
trillion was laundered worldwide.
""This is based on the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) money
laundering formula that states that the aggregate size of money laundering
in the world is between two and five percent of the world's gross domestic
product (GDP),"" she said.
In Malaysia, the AML and counter financing of terrorism (CFT)
legislative framework comes under the country's AML Act 2001, which in turn
keeps close pace with the international Financial Action Task Force on
Money Laundering's (FATF) 40+9 recommendations.
According to Lim, Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) is reviewing the guideline
for implementing a risk-based approach to monitor illicit activities such
as money laundering and terrorist financing.
Global banks and financial services institutions in the West are
leveraging cutting edge analytics (technology) in their AML measures.
In line with its strong commitment for AML, SAS has been named as the
world's best AML solution provider by Waters magazine recently.
""This award is a testament that we are addressing the specific industry

wife, both directors of an invesment company, were charged in the Seremban
Sessions Court today with 41 counts of receiving proceeds from unlawful
activity through on-line amounting to RM26,679,371 million.
The Briton was later produced in the Kuala Lumpur Sessions Court to
face another seven similar charges involving RM7,020,887.25.
The couple are the first offenders to be probed by Bank Negara since
the Anti-Money Laundering Act 2001 came into force and the company is also
the first to be involved in alleged illegal deposit-taking activities
through on-line.
Bryan John Marsden, 58, and his wife, Phan Sew Ken, 51, were picked up
from their house in Bandar Sunway this morning by officers from the Special
Investigation Unit of Bank Negara before they were produced at the Seremban
Sessions Court at about 1pm.
The court interpreter took almost 45 minutes to complete reading out
the 41 charges.
Marsden and Phan, as directors of New Mark Business Centres Sdn Bhd,
were alleged to have engaged in money laundering by receiving monies
totalling RM26,679,371 which were proceeds of unlawful activity through the
account of New Mark Business Centres Sdn Bhd.
The couple, who were not represented, allegedly committed the offences
at EON Bank Group, Taman Semarak, Nilai, between Dec 8 2003 and Jan 4 2005.
They are facing charges under section 4(1) of Anti Money Laundering Act
2001 read together with section 87(1) and face a maximum five years jail or
RM5 million fine, or both, on each charge if convicted.
They claimed trial to all the charges.
Phan, who briefly broke down in tears when deputy public prosecutor
Dzulkifli Ahmad proposed bail RM1 million for each of them, said they could
not raise such a big amount since Bank Negara had frozen their assets.
""Everything is gone and there's nothing left for us where we had work
hard to build our business,"" she added.
Judge Mohamed Zaki Abdul Wahab imposed bail of RM500,000 each with two
Malaysian sureties and ordered their passports to be surrendered to the
court pending trial.
He fixed Sept 13 for mention to enable them to appoint counsel.
In Kuala Lumpur, Marsden was produced before judge Akhtar Tahir at

"Curbing money laundering
Source:Business Times
MONEY laundering, the 'cleaning up' of 'dirty money', continues to be a
major challenge for financial institutions and law enforcement worldwide.
SHAREN KAUR looks at the issue from a local perspective
Criminal and terrorist activities more often than not generate
substantial amounts of income. The sale of pirated software or movies,
for example, involves little capital investment (no taxes, royalties, or
salaries for musicians and artists) but generates healthy returns.
That is the attractiveness of the ""underground"" economy.
However, in order for all this cash to be used without raising eyebrows
and alarms, it has to enter the system ""legitimately"". In other words, it
has to be ""cleaned"".
In the famous Hollywood gangster movies, a typical example of money
laundering would involve the channeling of illegal cash as ""revenue"" from
restaurants owned by the Mafia.
Nowadays, however, money laundering techniques have become more
sophisticated, which requires equally advanced monitoring and
surveillance by the authorities.
In Malaysia, all banks are governed by Bank Negara Malaysia guidelines
and they have to be aware of the Money Laundering Act when committing
transactions for clients.
Besides financial institutions, lawyers, jewellers, accountants and
gaming centres are being monitored regularly as they are the most likely
sectors and professionals to be used by criminals to launder money.
According to bankers and fund managers, curbing money laundering as
well as terrorist financing will take time and the efforts may not pay
off so well.
""Much effort is being put in to minimise the risk associated with money
laundering and terrorist financing and millions of dollars are spent
yearly. A lot can be done but the problem will remain worldwide,"" said a
fund manager with AmBank Group.
He said besides banks, regulators are also closely watching gaming
operators, as it has been perceived that terrorists are working with
criminals to launder their proceeds at casinos.
""Terrorists use high volume fraud activities to fund their operations,
and some are using ATMs and online payment systems to move money.
Everyone has to play safe these days,"" he said.
While money laundering is a process where cash is raised from criminal
activities and made to look legitimate for re-integration into the
financial system and economic activities, terrorist financing is more
concerned about what the funds can do.
These activities have become a major concern since the 9/11 terrorist
attack on the US in 2001.
MIMB Investment Bank Bhd, a newly created investment bank, is investing
in staff to create awareness on potential transactions that may be
associated with money laundering or terrorist financing.
Its director and co-head investment banking, Mohd Razlan Mohamed, said
MIMB's human resource department provides money laundering training to
all staff to detect such movement and raise the issue to the right
officials if there are any suspicious activities.
""Before we embark on any deals such as bonds or capital raising for our
clients, we will undertake a thorough assessment on the risk to see if
the deal has any money laundering effects,"" he told Business Times.
Razlan said once it is established that the deal has a very low risk of
money laundering elements and approved by the bank's risk assessment
committee, only then will the client's deal be approved.
He said MIMB staff would still continue to monitor the deal after
approval, and if there are any suspicious transactions being made, the
matter will be reported immediately to the bank's head of compliance for
appropriate action to be taken.
""Money laundering falls under the category of fraud. No matter how much
control we have, a fraud can still take place.
""Anything you do does not guarantee that it can prevent money
laundering. What we are able to do is to minimise the risk of exposure by
the bank to money laundering activities by our clients.
""For investment banking type of work, we have a choice. If we think the
transaction proposed by the client has a high risk of money laundering
activities, we will decline and walk away from the deal,"" Razlan added.
Low profile Malaysian tycoon Tan Sri Dr Chen Lip Keong, who owns
diversified businesses in Malaysia, Cambodia and Hong Kong, is determined
to combat terrorist financing and money laundering to protect the gaming
business that he is involved in from international threats.
Chen is the chief executive officer and founder of Hong Kong listed
NagaCorp Ltd, a gaming and entertainment group, which operates NagaWorld
Resort, the only legal casino in Phnom Penh, Cambodia.
NagaCorp has been working closely with Hill & Associates Risk
Consulting and Ernst & Young, and has also adopted some of the best
practices in prevention of money laundering recommended by the Financial
Action Task Force (FATF).
FATF, made up of 31 countries and territories and two regional
organisations, is an inter-Governmental body established in 1989 to
develop and promote policies at international levels to combat money
laundering and terrorist financing.
NagaWorld has put in place key anti-money laundering (AML) internal
controls, such as the stringent control of the issue of cheques and
provision of electronic funds transfers for the benefit of its casino
customers.
""Gaming operators have been linked to terrorist financing and money
laundering activities. To protect NagaWorld, we have appointed internal
and external experts to monitor the situation at the resort to ensure it
is free from such activities,"" Chen told Business Times in Kuala Lumpur
recently.
NagaCorp has also appointed Timothy McNally as chairman and independent
non-executive, and David Martin Hodson as executive director, and also
chairman of the AML Board Oversight Committee of the company, to minimise
the risk.
McNally was a special agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI) for 24 years, while Hodson was attached to the Hong Kong Police for
37 years, spending most of his career in criminal investigations.
""Terrorist financing is a global issue that requires well-coordinated,
multilateral response through various international fora such as the
United Nations, the FATF, and enforcement agencies,"" Hodson said.
Hodson said notwithstanding the preventative and mitigating measures
that a casino operator may adopt and observe, the risk of fraud and
cheating cannot be eradicated completely.
He said in view of the preventive and mitigative measures adopted by
NagaCorp, the management is of the view that the risk relating to fraud
and cheating in the casino can be managed.
He also said to combat terrorist financing and money laundering, any
organisations should have effective reporting and good internal controls,
and the right people that are very subjective in combating such issues.
""There's a lot of cash converted to cheques and moved in various
places. There is so much money going through banks and financial
institutions. A lot of people are converting illegal money and
illegitimate funds. It's a question of how you identify and detect these
activities. Everyone has to be a good corporate citizen and help furnish
the necessary details,"" he added.
According to McNally, gaming sectors should monitor its customers and
the transactions made by having proper equipment, CCTVs and trained
staff, while working closely with the police for feedback both ways.
""Companies are trying to generate revenue to support their illegitimate
business and casinos have been identified as a industry with potential
risk. We have to combat the problem to protect the gaming sector,"" he
said.
McNally said at NagaWorld, due diligence and screening of players are
carried out in accordance with the relevant recommendations issued by
FATF.
He said no cheques have even been issued to the public which prevents
the public floor from being exploited for money laundering.
""Today, as you walk into the casino with US$3,000 (RM10,260), you are
considered a regular player, but if you take more than US$10,000
(RM34,230) to the public floor, you will have to queue in a special line
and you will be monitored through CCTVs. If a suspicious transaction is
made, it will be reported immediately,"" he said.
He said visibility throughout the gaming area always remains clear and
unobstructed, and the layout of CCTVs and other surveillance systems are
sufficiently documented.
""Anti money laundering is not about dollars and cents spent but the
importance of combating the issue. NagaCorp has spent millions of dollars
to combat the problem, if not, minimise the risk,"" he added.
Tell-tale signs of 'dirty money'
THE following patterns of activity indicate collection and movement of
funds made via financial institutions that could be associated with money
laundering or terrorist financing: (Info obtained from several bankers)
* Account transactions that are inconsistent with past deposits or
withdrawals such as cash or cheques. Any transaction of a customer that
is not in accordance to his or her profile, will be considered
suspicious, thus raising concerns.
* Transactions involving a high volume of incoming or outgoing wire
transfers, that come from, go to, or transit through locations of concern
with no apparent purpose involves a high risk of money laundering and
terrorist financing activities.
* Unexplainable clearing or negotiation of third party cheques and

* Structuring at multiple branches or the same branch with multiple
activities or more commonly known as smurfing. Smurfing is a common
practice used by money launderers.
* Corporate layering, transfers between bank accounts of related
entities or charities for no apparent reasons. Customers who have few
accounts and co-mingle the funds will be closely monitored. All banks
have suitable tracking systems for this.
* Wire transfers by charitable organisations to companies located in
countries known to be bank or tax havens. This is highly associated with
terrorist financing activities.
* Using multiple accounts to collect funds that are then transferred to
the same foreign beneficiaries is an act of money laundering.
* Transactions with no logical economic purpose, that is, no link
between the activity of the organisation and other parties involved in
the transaction is also another form of money laundering.
* Cash debiting schemes in which deposits in the US correlate directly
with ATM withdrawals in countries of concern. Reverse transactions of
this nature are also suspicious and considered to be a risk of terrorist
financing.

"Labuan banks found to be free of money laundering
Source:Business Times
MALAYSIAN offshore banks are understood to have received a clean bill of
health from their Asia Pacific peers in respect of efforts to counter
money laundering activities.
The prognosis augurs well for the country's 60-odd offshore banks and
other institutions operating out of the Labuan International Offshore
Financial Centre (IOFC), as well as the government's moves to promote the
centre itself.
The banks, which had reported a strong 2000 financial year when their
combined pre-tax profit doubled to US$118.8 million (US$1 = RM3.80), were
recently subjected to a test to determine the efficacy of their anti-money
laundering mechanism.
""Initial feedback suggests that the Labuan offshore banks will get a
clean bill,"" said a source familiar with their operations.
""Our offshore institutions are not known to be money laundering targets,
but they must remain vigilant as money launderers do target countries with
rapidly growing financial centres, but which may lack adequate controls,""
the source said.
The Asia Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG) had held a series of
meetings with Labuan's offshore banks and the Labuan Offshore Authority
(Lofsa), and inspected systems that have been put in place to combat money
laundering.
The Australian-based APG comprises 21-member countries. It promotes the
adoption, implementation and enforcement of internationally accepted anti-
money laundering standards.
Offshore centres have tended to be viewed as ""havens"" for money
launderers who are engaged in criminal activities like drug trafficking,
illegal arms sales, smuggling and prostitution.
They have also been known to play host to money derived from such
activities as embezzlement, insider trading, and computer fraud schemes,
all of which can pose a serious threat to the financial system and the
confidence of genuine investors.
""APG members agree to be subjected to mutual evaluations,"" said another
banking source.
An official communique of the AGP's fact-finding mission to Malaysia
will be submitted to the Malaysian authorities this month.
The grouping, which started conducting mutual evaluations in 2000, also
assists members to enact laws to stem illegal activities, including
confiscation of assets and extradition of perpetrators.
It provides guidance to set up systems for the reporting and
investigation of suspicious transactions and the establishment of
financial intelligence units.
Finance Minister Tun Daim Zainuddin had last November said that a
separate anti-money laundering legislation for the Labuan IOFC was being
drafted to preserve Labuan's image as a credible and reputable
international offshore centre able to withstand the most intense of
scrutinies.
Once the law comes in effect, Malaysia would comply with international
money laundering standards as spelt out by the Group of Seven countries'
Financial Action Task Force.
It is understood that under the new law, offenders can be fined up to
RM5 million and jailed for five years.
Among the big names in global banking that have set up shop in Labuan
are Standard Chartered Bank, Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp, Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Fuji Bank, BNP Paribas, Dresdner Bank and Deutsche Bank.
The local players include Arab-Malaysian Merchant Bank, the Labuan
Offshore branch of Bank Muamalat, Public Bank, Maybank International, RHB
Bank, Danaharta Managers, Bumiputra-Commerce Bank, Schroders Malaysia,
Citibank Malaysia, AMMB International, Bank Islam and JP Morgan Malaysia.

ARMED with a set of anti-money laundering legislation already in place,
Malaysia will be a comfortable host for the fourth annual meeting of the
Asia Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG) next week.
Malaysia is also expected to receive good news in terms of recently
conducted money laundering checks on the country's offshore financial

It is understood that Malaysia's offshore centre, under the supervision
of the Labuan Offshore Authority, has received clearance where money
laundering activities is concerned.
An APG announcement to that effect may be made at the two-day meeting,
which will be opened by Finance Minister Tun Daim Zainuddin on May 22.
APG, the Australian-based grouping comprising 21 member countries,
attempts to ensure the adoption, implementation and enforcement of
internationally accepted anti-money laundering standards.
Bank Negara Malaysia, taking the lead role as co-chairman of the
grouping, said that hosting the annual meeting is testimony of the
country's support for the international initiative against money
laundering.
One of the latest efforts is the Malaysian Anti-Money Laundering Bill
2001, which was passed by the Dewan Rakyat on May 10. The newly introduced
law puts Malaysia's legislation against money laundering on par with
international standards.
One such standard involves the 40 recommendations spelt out by the

The Bill includes criminalising money laundering, imposing obligations
of customer identification, record keeping and reporting of suspicious
transactions by institutions.
It also allows for the seizing, freezing and forfeiture of properties
that are proceeds of money-laundering activities.
According to Bank Negara Malaysia, the Bill was formulated in
consultation with 13 government ministries and agencies involved in
combating money laundering.
Business Times recently reported that Malaysian offshore banks had
received a clean bill of health against money-laundering activities from

A TWO-DAY seminar to discuss recent initiatives to combat
money-laundering will be held in Labuan beginning September 28 2004.
Jointly organised by the Labuan Offshore Financial Services Authority
(Lofsa) and Malaysian Institute of Banks, the seminar will see
participants exchanging experiences in checking money laundering.
The seminar's main objectives are to update participants on local and
global legislative developments pertaining to the act of money laundering
with particular reference to offshore financial services.
A Lofsa spokesman said an overview of international compliance
standards to check money laundering will be presented at the seminar.
The seminar is also aimed at equipping participants with practical
guidelines for implementing an effective compliance programme in line
with anti-money laundering recommendations.
Its targeted audience are senior management and senior executives of
financial institutions responsible for compliance with anti-money
laundering laws and international standards.
The seminar is part of Lofsa's ongoing effort to ensure that Labuan as
an international offshore financial centre continue to be free from
money-laundering activities.
As of August this year, there are 4,281 registered offshore companies
in Labuan, including 57 offshore banks and investment banks, 102 offshore

MALAYSIA is prepared to go all out to prevent terrorists from gaining
access to sources of finance.
The fight against ""terror financing"" and money-laundering transcends
borders and Malaysia will work with the international community to prevent
those involved in the menace from abusing the international financial
system.
At home, Malaysia has tightened laws and institutional frameworks while
internationally it participates in the Asia-Pacific Group on Money
Laundering (APG) and other forums.
Bank Negara Malaysia is now leading the National Coordination Committee
to Counter Money Laundering. Formed in April 2000, the committee comprises
representatives of various law enforcement agencies.
The Anti-Money Laundering Act 2001 was enforced from January 15 this
year.
The Act covers the general aspects of money laundering, investigations,
freezing of funds, seizure and forfeiture of proceeds from serious crimes
and suspected transactions. It also governs record-keeping requirements
and the establishment of a Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU).
The FIU was established within the central bank's jurisdiction on August
8 last year, essentially to enforce the Act and to forge closer
cooperation with foreign countries in fighting the menace.
The country has also entered into various multilateral agreements to
combat international terrorism.
Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines signed a trilateral agreement on
terrorism in May this year. The aim is to check cross-border incidents and
transnational crimes.
A joint declaration on cooperation to combat international terrorism was
signed with the US, also in May this year, which, among others, allows for
exchange of information on terror financing, documents and data.
Malaysia also entered into a memorandum of understanding for a similar

between government and government.
""Financial crime is a global contagion. International cooperation is a

The workshop aims to equip participants with the necessary knowledge

accordance with the Anti-Money Laundering Act 2001.
The workshop which ends today was jointly organised by the Labuan

Shafie said another initiative is the South-East Asia Centre for
Counter-Terrorism established in July, showing Malaysia's commitment to
criminalise the financing of terrorism as called for under the United
Nations Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism.
He said some training initiatives undertaken by the centre were to
identify and detect money laundering and terrorist financing, development
of laws and policies related to reporting or suspicious transactions, and
training to ensure timely analysis and dissemination of information on

"New law boosts fight against money laundering
Source:Business Times
THE Anti-Money Laundering Act 2001 will place certain limits on banking
secrecy practices in Malaysia, and put greater responsibility in the hands
of financial managers.
Section 20 of the Act states that the provisions ""shall have effect
notwithstanding any obligation as to secrecy or other restriction on the
disclosure of information imposed by any written law or otherwise"".
Thus, authorities are empowered to look into what is deemed to be
illegimate transactions.
""This is Malaysia's statutory testimony in its fight against corruption
and matters linked with it, particularly money laundering,"" said Minister
in the Prime Minister's Department, Datuk Seri Dr Rais Yatim.
Opening the two-day Anti-Money Laundering Act 2001 seminar in Kuala
Lumpur yesterday, he also highlighted the punishment of RM5 million fine
or five year imprisonment, or both, under the Act.
""For bankers, in particular, this may be a far reaching statutory power
and penalty, but so far the provision has not created the anti-calm
disposition as some quarters expected before the coming into force of the
instrument,"" he said.
For one, bankers note that the new law requires banks, termed as
reporting institutions, to inform the authorities on certain exceptional
or suspicious transactions that may involve proceeds from unlawful
activity.
Reporting institutions are divided into bank and non-bank financial
institutions. The former includes banks, merchant banks, Islamic banks and
Labuan offshore banks.
The non-bank financial institutions include finance companies, discount
houses, money brokers, insurers, Takaful companies, securities dealers,
money changers and future brokers.
Bankers note that combating money-laundering requires a watchful eye on
the part of the banks and other institutions involved.

"New law a powerful tool against money laundering
Source:Business Times
MALAYSIA'S Anti-Money Laundering Act 2001 provides a strong foundation for
the country to curb money-laundering activities, says Finance Minister Tun
Daim Zainuddin.
He said the new law is comprehensive and covers most of the 40
recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering
(FATF), which are the world's accepted standards against money laundering.
""Reporting by financial institutions is now not by administrative
requirement but is legal and obligatory. The new law also contains
investigative powers that are ordinarily given to investigation officers,""
he said in his keynote address at the three-day fourth annual meeting of
the Asia Pacific Group on Money Laundering (AGP) held in Kuala Lumpur
yesterday.
The FATF's 40 recommendations set the global standards on legal,
financial and regulatory, and law enforcement. They provide, among others,
provisions for the confiscation of laundered property and prohibit
anonymous accounts.
Daim said as the international community sets out to combat money
laundering, the focus should not be on the ""so-called inadequate
observance of international standards"".
""Rather, the focus should be on provision of on-going technical
assistance and training to facilitate compliance. Such a constructive and
developmental approach will be fairer and will yield more positive
results,"" he said.
Admittedly, Daim said, Malaysia faces constraints and limitations in
dealing with the complex and global nature of money laundering but its
participation in the APG has enabled the country to get involved in mutual
evaluation programmes.
Malaysia has responded to the international community's calls by
enacting the Anti-Money Laundering Act 2001, he added.
The law was passed by Parliament early this month.
In her opening address, Bank Negara Malaysia Governor Datuk Dr Zeti
Akhtar Aziz said a coordinated national effort against money laundering
has been realised by setting up the National Coordination Committee to
Counter Money Laundering (NCC), involving 13 ministries and government
agencies as its members.4
""It is responsible for developing national policies and measures to
counter money laundering and coordinate Malaysia's responses to
international initiatives againts money laundering,"" she said.
As the lead agency for the NCC, Bank Negara is committed to ensuring
that the integrity of the Malaysian financial system is not in any way
compromised by criminal activities.
The central bank has issued guidelines in compliance with the FATF's 40
recommendations through the requirement of customer identification and
verification, financial record-keeping and mandatory reporting of
suspicious activity.
""The guidelines were issued to prevent banking institutions from being
used as a conduit for money laundering,"" she said.
In addition, Minimum Guidelines on the Provision of Internet Banking
Services were issued last May, which require banking institutions to have
face-to-face interaction with customers prior to the opening of accounts
or extension of credit.
This was later followed by the Guidelines on Anti-Money Laundering
Measures for the Insurance Industry last month, which ask insurance
intermediaries to put in place controls to counter money laundering by
verifying customers' identity, keeping records, recognising and reporting
suspicious customers or transactions.
Zeti noted that offshore financial centres, such as the Labuan
International Offshore Financial Centre, have come under the focus of the
international community as they are said to be vulnerable to abuses by
money launderers.
""The Labuan Offshore Financial Services Authority will continuously
assess and upgrade the legal and supervisory framework to ensure that it
is on par with the latest international supervisory requirements,"" she
said.
Labuan has volunteered to be assessed by the APG to demonstrate its
commitment to fighting money-laundering activities.
The evaluation team comprising evaluators from the APG and the Offshore
Group of Banking Supervisors has met with the respective ministries,
government agencies and Labuan offshore players. An evaluation report on
Labuan is expected to be tabled after the evaluation, Zeti added.

"Anti-money laundering still much 'work in progress': KPMG
Source:Business Times
ANTI-MONEY laundering is still very much ""work in progress"" within the
banking industry, with plenty of work left to be done, but banks are
clearly committed to the war against money laundering and international
terror.
In its 2004 Anti-Money Laundering Survey, consulting firm KPMG said the
challenge for policymakers and law enforcement is to engage the industry
more effectively, give banks evidence that their efforts are leading to
higher detection rates and prevent the industry from being used by
criminals.
According to the survey, banks across the world are putting more money
into anti-money laundering (AML) systems and meeting compliance
requirements than ever before.
Of the 209 financial services institutions interviewed about their
spending over the last three years, 83 per cent said they have invested
more in AML systems, on average by 61 per cent more.
The trend is set to continue with most banks expecting spending to rise
by over 40 per cent over the next three years, demonstrating that much
remains to be done to enhance AML systems and controls.
KPMG says the main driver behind the past and projected increase in
spending is transaction monitoring. Banks are steadily increasing the
sophistication of their monitoring methodology with over 40 per cent of
respondents having already implemented externally developed automated
monitoring software.
While many banks continue to rely on staff vigilance and exception
reports, many of these are planning to implement more sophisticated
systems.
Training is the second biggest contributing factor to increased
spending, with banks showing a strong preference for face-to-face
training than computer-based training.
KPMG says increased regulation and fears over financing of terrorist
groups have undoubtedly boosted investment in AML measures and the banks
have rightly identified transaction monitoring and training as key areas
for investment.

billion) in 2007.
The offshore leasing business was one of the fastest growing in Labuan,
with total new lease financing rising 18.7 per cent to US$14.1 billion
(RM44.42 billion), boosted by strong activities in the oil an gas as well
as shipping in the region.
The offshore reinsurance business grew 40.3 per cent to US$919.2
million (RM2.9 billion) last year, of which 62 per cent were
non-Malaysian premiums, signalling its growing position as a reinsurance
centre. Retakaful contributions grew by 42.8 per cent to US$108.4 million

For 2007, total Islamic assets also posted an increase of 36.9 per cent
to US$1.2 billion (RM3.78 billion), Zeti said, adding that there has been
strong interest from investors from the Middle East seeking to invest in
the Asian region.

"Be more aware of money-laundering, staff told
Source:Business Times
MONEY-laundering is a difficult problem for banks and other financial
institutions to overcome, especially if their staff do not have the right
mindset to deal with the issue, says an expert.
Nigel Morris-Cotterill of AML Net Sdn Bhd said financial institutions
need to have their employees put money-laundering on top of their minds
when dealing with customer-related services.
""But to get the culture changed is not easy, because the mere fact that
people take up a job with banks does not make them a different person,""
Morris-Cotterill said in an interview recently.
The ideal situation would be employees in the banking and financial
sector always on the alert for the possibility of money laundering
whenever dealing with customers, he added.
There is also the matter of proper training for workers to detect money
laundering, said Morris-Cotterill, who has over 10-year experience in
providing strategies to counter money laundering strategies.
""It doesn't matter how good your systems are if your staff don't know
how to use them, and it doesn't matter how good the law is if the workers
don't know what it is,"" he said.
However, he admitted that the situation is the same anywhere in the
world and it will take a long time for changes to happen. There is also no
guarantee that money laundering will be wiped out completely as criminals
will always be looking for new ways to put their money in the system.
As it gets more difficult for criminals to go to banks to offload their
money, Morris-Cotterill said, they are more likely to use businesses such
as car dealers, law firms and real estate agents.
""An ordinary, simple and legitimate business can find itself a victim of
a money-laundering scheme,"" he said.
Part of the Hong Kong-based Anti Money Laundering Network Ltd, AML Net
provides technical support services to the group, produces and markets its
products to financial businesses in developing countries and small
financial services providers worldwide.
Uniquely, AML Net's products are designed especially for older, lower-
grade technology so that users do not have to invest in new computers to
run them.
The Multimedia Supercorridor-status company's first product is
GlobalKYC.com, a customer checking system to enable banks and financial
services centres to screen clients to ensure that they are not dealing
with ""banned"" persons.
Another product is AMLJobsSearch.com, a global job search website for
counter-money laundering professionals.
Morris-Cotterill said the response from the local banks and financial
institutions to AML Net's products has been encouraging.
He explained that the content of GlobalKYC.com was designed to be
extremely accessible, even during peak Internet hours. Morris-Cotterill
writes most of the content of the site, updating it almost daily.
Meanwhile, AML Net's sister company, Risk Values Ltd, has developed a
consumer profiling tool that allows a bank to identify those who have
propensity to commit financial crime.
Morris-Cotterill said the product does not depend on transaction
history, racial, address or other personal indicators.
Using a questionnaire format, the profiling tool will help financial
institutions look for people who display personality traits that will
allow them to enter into an abusive relationship with a bank.
Morris-Cotterill said the idea of introducing the tool came after seeing
the treatment given to Muslims in the US after the September 11 attacks in
2001.
""This whole idea of prejudicing against people based solely on their
religion or racial background was one of the main motivators for Risk
Values,"" he said.
With its accuracy rate of about 85 per cent, Morris-Cotterill said the
tool is particularly useful for online transactions and applications.

"On the global trails of money laundering
Source:New Straits Times
SCENARIO 1: Mr Big is filthy rich. ""Filthy"" aptly describes his millions
stashed away in bank accounts in Caribbean islands, funds derived from
drug trafficking, prostitution and other illicit activities.
He decides to bring his dirty money home. But how does he legalise it so
he will not rouse the suspicion of the authorities? He sets up an offshore
company which is engaged in a legitimate business such as venture capital.
Through this venture capital company, he invests in a local business back
home. His dirty money is thus ""sanitised"" (laundered), and he can
officially enjoy it because it is now seen as profits from the local joint
venture.
Scenario 2: Mr Con obtains a policy for a ""phantom"" ocean-going vessel.
He pays premiums on the policy, and bribes agents to facilitate and pay
claims, always making sure his claims are lower than the premiums he pays.
This way, the insurer still enjoys a ""profit"", and through this process,
Mr Con receives laundered funds from a legitimate and reputable source.
Scenario 3: Mr Chips takes gamblers on junkets to casinos in Europe, the
Philippines and Australia where large sums of money are laundered. His
clients don't have to carry money with them. All they do is to provide
him, in local currency, the amount they intend to bring with them to the
casinos. He also accepts banker's cheques.
He then informs the casinos of the amount of money deposited with him.
On arrival at the casino, his clients are provided with the amount in
gambling chips.
Unused chips are exchanged for a cheque from the casinos. Because of Mr
Chip's casino connection, syndicates make use of his services to launder
money in and out of the country.
The money launderer comes in many other guises as well. According to
international investigators, these are some of the businesses used to hide
dirty cash: property dealers, photocopying bureaux, carpet traders,
fairground operators, mobile telephone importers and computer memory chip
suppliers.
What is money laundering?
It is a generic term describing the process by which illegally obtained
money is transformed into ""clean"" money that has the appearance of
originating from a legitimate source.
The money laundering process is generally made up of three stages:
* The placement stage where illegitimate funds find their way into the
financial system via payment into legitimate accounts. For example,
depositing cash in banks which ask no questions, investing in deposit
taking companies, buying precious metals/diamonds, or artwork/stamp
collections.
* The layering stage which is used to disguise the audit trail between
the funds and the original point of entry into the system. This is done by
moving the funds around so that the origins of the money become obscured.
For example, through wire transfers across borders, bonds, ""wins"" at the
race track or regional casinos, and the use of offshore financial centres
which either have strict banking secrecy laws or lax regulation.
* The integration stage where funds are reintroduced as legitimate
wealth to fund further activities or to acquire assets. This includes
loans to self/companies and false invoices, and other attempts to make the
wealth look honest.
While no one knows exactly how much money is being laundered worldwide,
a United Nations report puts it at US$600 billion (RM2,280 billion) per
year, of which only two per cent is seized.
The fight against money laundering globally has been undertaken
primarily by the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force on Money
Laundering. The FATF, under the umbrella of the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development, has established 40 principles covering
financial regulation, law enforcement and international co-operation.
Set up in 1989 by the Group of Seven - leading industrial countries
Japan, United States, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada - to
attack the drug trade, FATF comprises 31 countries and two international
organisations: the European Commission and the Gulf Co-operation Council.
Participants in FATF include representatives from members' financial
regulatory authorities, law enforcement agencies, and the Ministries of
Finance, Justice and External Affairs. Representatives of international
and regional organisations concerned with combating money laundering are
observers at FATF meetings.
Nineteen financial centres that fall short of international standards
have been blacklisted by the FATF. There are three in Europe - Russia,
Hungary and Ukraine.
Five on the ""hit list"" are in the Caribbean and Central America -
Dominica, Grenada, St Kitts & Nevis, St Vincent & the Grenadines, and
Guatemala.
In Africa and the Middle East, the four blacklisted countries are Egypt,
Israel, Lebanon and Nigeria. The seven in the Asia Pacific region are Cook
Islands, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Myanmar, Philippines and
Indonesia.

Source:New Straits Times
THE Government will ensure that the implementation of e-commerce will not
give any avenue for violation of regulations and encourage money
laundering, Deputy Finance Minister Datuk Shafie Mohd Salleh said.
He said among the issues identified with respect to the implementation
of e-commerce were the legal and regulatory framework for Internet
transactions, security and privacy of information, access to the Internet,
market access to suppliers over the Internet, trade facilitation and
public procument.
Winding up the debate on the Offshore Banking (Amendment) Bill 2000, he
said the law would ensure that the implementation of the virtual platform
would not provide any avenue for violation of laws and promote money
laundering.
Shafie said the authority would determine the criteria and the rules and
regulations for participation in e-commerce.
Earlier, a Senator reminded the Labuan supervisory authority to monitor
the operations of the financial off-shore centre to ensure that it would
not become a centre to recycle ""black money"".
Senator Datuk Abdul Aziz Abdul Rahman said with the development of new
activities and opportunities by the Internet, particularly cross-border
transactions, measures should be taken by the Government to ensure that
Labuan would not be just another conduit for irresponsible parties.
""We hope that Labuan will not be the centre for money laundering where
large amount of money comes from drug sales and illegal gambling.""
""It is also our hope that Labuan will not be turned into a centre to
recycle black money similar to that in the Carribean islands,"" he said
when debating the Bill.
Abdul Aziz said to address such problems, the Carribean authorities had
set up a financial action task force to monitor the development of such
activities around the islands.
""With the advancement of computer technologies, the Internet can be used
to reach new markets and expanding promotional and marketing activities.
""It can be a powerful business tool.""
Therefore, he said, measures must be taken to ensure that Labuan was
free from such activities which would negate efforts made by the
Government to develop Labuan into an international off-shore financial
centre.
""In order to attain the status of a world-class off-shore financial
centre, the Government must constantly monitor and supervise Labuan's
development so that there will be a strict check and balance so that the
place will not associated with activities that can tarnish it image.""
Abdul Aziz said in facing challanges of the new millenium where e-
commerce has revolutionised the normal way of conducting business, clearly
there was a need for a global financial structure.
""This will enable the authorities to monitor e-commerce and also address
problems of hackers,"" he said.
Datuk Dr Chin Fook Wing said in developing Labuan as a vibrant
international off-shore centre in the region, the Government must ensure
that the administrative machinery in supervising the activities and
operations of the centre were efficient.
""Using e-commerce, money will be transferred in seconds.
""The authorities must therefore, administer, enforce, carry out any laws
relating to off-shore financial services in Labuan so that it will
maintain as a reputable centre for off-shore services.""
The Bill was later passed.

"Anti-money laundering compliance
Source:New Straits Times
ORGANISATIONS have to comply with the anti-money laundering (AML) and
counter-financing of terrorism (CFT) laws. For a start, an organisation
should espouse these five building blocks or deliverables for its AML/CFT
corporate management:
* Compliance programme - Based on guidelines from the regulators,
financial action task force.
* Policies and procedures - Board of directors' approval, know your
customers (KYCs), enhanced due diligence, training programmes, oversight
committee, compliance officer/programme director, reporting structure.
* Training - For all levels of staff. Recognising and reporting of
suspicious transaction reports (STRs).
* Client and ""onboard"" sponsorship - Politically exposed person (PEP)
filters, escalation and monitoring framework, filters, reporting rules.
Emphasise the importance of documentation for STRs before and after the
arrest of suspects.
* Investigating and monitoring - Compliance officers' independence and
integrity. Be mindful of the statement, ""You can only monitor what you
can control"".
Perhaps a better way to avail a more complete profile of the AML/CFT
element in your business' database would be to go beyond KYC, which is
knowing your ABCDE.
What does ABCDE stand for? It simply means knowing the profiles of your
Agents, Beneficiaries, Customers, Debtors and Employees - most
importantly, your employees because they are the ones who could spring
surprises and could be the conduit or mole for those customers that
intend to perpetrate money laundering and engage in the financing of
terrorism activities.
Organisations can stamp out the money laundering and financing of
terrorism evils by conducting their KYC and knowing their ABCDE. Simple
processes such as customer identification and verification, and
conducting due diligence on clients will go a long way to eradicate the
proliferation of money laundering and financing of terrorism.
A good way to screen customers is to use the risk-based approach,
whereby appropriate measures should be taken for prohibited relationships
and to avoid dubious trading activities.
Undertaking due diligence. A financial institution, for example,
normally performs three kinds of due diligence, namely filtering,
searching and monitoring.
* Filtering: The financial institution filters or screens payment
instructions such as fund or wire transfers prior to executing the
transfer. By doing this, it can prevent funds that are in breach of
sanctions, embargoes or other measures from being made available.
* Searching: The financial institution conducts retroactive searches,
that is it identifies specific past transactions besides doing searches
for existing and closed accounts.
* Monitoring: When the financial institution monitors AML/CFT
activities, it keeps tabs on the transactions after their execution in
order to nab or single out unusual transactions. This includes putting
aside and segregating or looking at single transactions as well as the
specific transaction flows.
Ongoing monitoring. Organisations should conduct ongoing scrutiny and
due diligence. They should perform ongoing scrutiny of the accounts and
transactions of their customers throughout the course of the business
relationship. This is to ensure that the transactions that are being
conducted are consistent with the organisation's knowledge of the
customers. Also, such ongoing monitoring of the customers' businesses and
risk profiles can facilitate the identification of the sources of funds.
An organisation should know at least the minimum seven risk areas where
businesses or individuals could reside. If it knows these risk areas, it
can perform a proper due diligence and further its enhanced due diligence.
The seven risk areas are PEPs, high net worth individuals,
intermediaries and agencies, sensitive country connections (for example,
non-co-operative countries and territories and known drug-trafficking
havens), unusual business or suspicious transaction activities, shell
banks or third-rated correspondent banks, and sensitive industry
connections.
Due diligence and enhanced due diligence will result in a customer
being accepted, a customer being rejected, and a customer's continuous
monitoring.
It is important to have credible and reliable information before any
meaningful due diligence or enhanced due diligence is going to be of any
use. Reports have to be evidenced and factual. Use the analogy of
""business intelligence is vital"". Be mindful of the deficiencies of
online information. Organisations should know or have their business
partners' data. Are they up-to-date? And if information/data is
outsourced, be sure that the methods used are integral and legal.
Policies and procedures. Policies and procedures should be developed to
identify customer and business types that pose high risk of money
laundering and financing of terrorism. Such policies and procedures need
to incorporate the following minimum generic features:
* Nature of the customer's business - Is it high risk of money
laundering?
* Origin of the customer - Birth place, location and place of business,
location of counter-parties.
* Complex corporate ownership.
* Is the customer linked to PEPs?

""For instance, RTD will retrieve the driving licence of the person
involved in transporting contraband. They may also withdraw the road tax
or permit of vehicles used in smuggling.
""TNB could, on its part, cut off the electricity supply to buildings
that are used as a centre of smuggling,"" she said.
She said the joint anti-smuggling effort with RTD and TNB was also
targeted at car smugglers, especially those using Johor as their smuggling

KUALA LUMPUR, Fri. - A former freelance land broker was charged in the
Sessions Court today with money laundering involving RM2 million, making
him the second person to be charged under the Anti-Money Laundering Act

guilty to receiving the money, allegedly proceeds from illegal activities,
in a Standard Chartered Bank cheque from an account belonging to Syed
Ahmad Faudzi Syed Abu Bakar, 35.
The offence was allegedly committed at Standard Chartered Malaysia
Berhad, No. 2, Jalan Ampang, on Jan 9 last year.
Money laundering is punishable with a fine up to RM5 million, or jail up
to five years, or both.
The first person to be charged under the Act was a medical doctor, Dr

laundering involving more than RM41 million.
Judge Rosenani Abdul Rahman released Gan on RM200,000 bail in one surety
and ordered that he surrender his passport to the court pending hearing on
Sept 19.
Deputy Public Prosecutor Masri Mohd Daud had earlier urged the court to
impose a bail of RM500,000 in one surety, saying that the charge against
Gan was very serious and it involved a total sum of RM9 million.
Gan's counsel V. Kumaresan urged the court for a reduced bail, saying
that his client was currently unemployed.
He said the amount suggested by the prosecution was far too high .
Kumaresan also said the RM2 million in alleged proceeds from illegal

""I had only wanted to borrow the money to start a business but it
failed. I could not repay it due to the poor economic situation,"" he said.

"Legislation to check money laundering

A special law may be enacted to prevent money laundering by international
syndicates through the Labuan International Off-shore Financial Centre,
Deputy Finance Minister Datuk Dr Affifuddin Omar.
""The laws and regulations we have now are adequte to prevent money
laundering activities in Labuan.
""However, I do not say it is a watertight system,"" Affifuddin said in
reply to a supplementary question from Lim Guan Eng (DAP-Kota Melaka) who
asked if it was necessary to set up a special body to monitor money
laundering.
""Currently the Government is monitoring business activities in Labuan.
However, should money laundering become rampant, a special law may be
introduced,"" Affifuddin added.
In the original question, Wan Mohd Jamil Wan Mahmood (PAS-Tumpat) asked
what legislation there was to control money laundering in Labuan IOFC.
""Laws in Labuan IOFC are meant to curb and ensure that Labuan does not
become a centre for money laundering by international syndicates.
""Strict rules and regulations are enforced on the off-shore banking
industry. Only reputable and high-ranking banks are allowed to operate.
""This is to ensure that they have the capital, expertise, ethical
standards and sound banking ethics,"" Affifuddin said.
The Labuan Off-Shore and Financial Services Authority, from time to
time, came up with regulations such as in 1996 when they distributed such
guidelines to Labuan banks.
Meanwhile, to prevent money laundering activities from the start, off-
shore banks had to cross check customer backgrounds before allowing them
to open accounts.
They were not allowed to credit bank accounts with cash but only through
telegraphic transfer.
Off-shore banks were also not allowed to produce bearer shares to avoid

ASIAN and European Finance Ministers will have a series of discussions
over the next four months over urgent issues such as international money-
laundering and financing of terrorists, to be tabled at the Asia-Europe
Economic Meeting (Asem) Summit in Hanoi in October.
The discussions will begin next month at the Asem Finance Ministers
meeting in Brussels. They will review the outcome of the Sixth Asem
Foreign Ministers meeting in Kildare, Ireland, two months ago.
Senior French Government officials said the issues requiring urgent
solution included the lowering of customs tariffs and the security of
investments.
It is understood that money-laundering is also high on the agenda in
view of the implications on the funding of terrorist activities.
An official said there were ""several offshore centres"" which were not
co-operating in efforts to stop money-laundering.
""Efforts are being made to encourage dialogue and to come to a common
understanding on issues like good corporate governance,"" the official told
journalists from 12 countries, here to study the dynamics of Asem.
The meeting at Kildare had agreed on the need for co-operation to reduce
the access of terrorists to financial and other economic resources,
besides addressing factors contributing to support and recruitment into
terrorism.
Officials said there was very little consensus between European and
Asian nations on customs tariffs.
This, coupled with the inability to agree on a stable framework for the
security of investments, are believed to be holding up discussions on
other pressing economic issues.
""We feel there is a need for a minimum set of rules in each
participating country to ensure the security of investments,"" the official
said, adding that investors need to be assured that their investments
would be protected in case of nationalisation of industries in any Asem
country.
It is understood that the task force for a closer economic partnership
between Europe and Asia has identified several proposals for discussions
in Brussels next month.
""It has been working hard on several proposals from Asem members, and we

"Infamous Nigerian money laundering scam resurfaces
Source:New Straits Times
KUALA LUMPUR, Mon. - After a 16-month break, the infamous Nigerian money
laundering scam has resurfaced, offering businessmen the opportunity to
earn millions of US dollars in the form of contract commissions.
Believed to be operating out of Johannesburg, South Africa, this time
around, the conmen have been sending letters to individuals and companies
offering them a chance to make a fortune.
The author, claiming to be a senior consultant for a mining corporation,
states in his letters that he is seeking assistance from a foreign partner
to provide an overseas bank account to facilitate the transfer of US$30
million.
The writer claims that a contract worth US$120 million was awarded but
together with fellow members of the contract awarding committee, it was
inflated to US$150 million.
""The contract has been successfully executed and the actual contractors
paid US$120 million in full.
""We, therefore, want to transfer out of the country for disbursement
among ourselves, the sum of US$30 million,"" the writer said.
Assuring a 30 per cent fee for services rendered, the writer said that
60 per cent would be taken up by members of the contract awarding
committee while the remainder would be set aside for expenses incurred.
The writer sought a bank account number in Malaysia to facilitate the
transfer of funds.
""We intend to come over to Malaysia on the completion of the fund
transfer to secure our own share of the fund.""
Giving the assurance that the transaction was 100 per cent risk free,
the writer also advised businessmen not to expose the proposal due to its
confidential nature.
Since it first surfaced in the country in the early 1990s, more than 100
complaints have been lodged with police over the scam.
Police and Nigerian High Commission officials here had repeatedly warned
the public not to fall prey to the so-called ""100 per cent risk-free""
offers.
In ensuring a successful sting, the conmen use forged documents and
unallocated telephone and fax lines which always lead investigators to a
dead end.
Reported cases from Malaysia include a businessman who lost RM700,000 to
the conmen, by mortgaging his house and selling his car, and a woman who
flew to Togo, West Africa, to deliver RM187,000.
There have been reports lodged by businessmen who alleged they were
cheated of RM2.5 million by such syndicates.
In 1997, police launched a nationwide operation and detained 143
Nigerians involved in such fraud.
Investigations then revealed that syndicate members based here picked
their intended victims using the Yellow Pages, newspapers and business
organisations. They would then follow up with a letter with a forged
letterhead.
Following the crackdown, the con seemed to have lost its sting until
recently.

"Accounts manager probed for money laundering
Source:New Straits Times
KUALA LUMPUR: Accounts manager Ong Kheng Hoe, who is facing 60 charges of
cheating and forging valuable security documents worth RM41 million, is
also being investigated under the Anti-Money Laundering Act.
The 37-year-old is also facing a RM27.606 million civil suit filed by
his former employer, Meridian Assets Management Sdn Bhd.
It is learnt that the police commercial crimes division is
investigating Ong but it is still unclear at what stage the
investigations are at.
The division had taken three months to build a case of cheating and
forgery against Ong, which saw him being charged last week.
It is also understood that the Securities Commission is investigating
Ong for allegedly using illegal proceeds of the transaction to invest in
the futures market.
Meridian Assets had obtained an order from High court Judge Datuk Abdul
Wahab Said on Sept 28 to freeze assets owned by Ong and three other
defendants.
The defendants in the civil suit are said to be his wife and two of his
siblings.
Ong was suspended and sacked as manager in April last year.
He allegedly forged his boss' signature on a valuable document relating
to investments from his company's clients - Malaysian Assurance Alliance
Pro-Life, MAA Annuity and Kumpulan Wang Amanah Pencen - between June 20,
2002, and April 18, 2005.
He allegedly faxed the document to a trustee company holding the
accounts.
After making a representation and withdrawing the funds, he invested
the money into share accounts operated by him and family members.
His caper went undetected until last year following checks by his
employer with the trustee company.
Ong was produced in court last week and charged with using Meridian
Asset's transfer authorisation letter worth RM600,000, allegedly signed
by its managing director, Nicholas T.Y. Ng, to transfer funds owned by
MAA Life in Ambank (M) Bhd to TA Futures Sdn Bhd's Maybank account.
He did this while allegedly knowing that the document faxed to Am
Trustee Bhd, which held the MAA Life policy, was forged.
Ong did not enter a plea.

"Anti-money laundering dynamics
Source:New Straits Times
FRAMEWORK on counter terrorist-financing. In 1999, the United Nations
drafted a regulatory framework on terrorist financing. This framework is
skewed mainly towards looking at the funds or monies that terrorists used
to finance their clandestine activities. The framework does not focus on
the other aspect of terrorism, and that is, ""what is the root cause of
terrorism""? To have an all-round picture of what terrorism is all about,
it would be important or necessary to understand the root causes of
terrorism. Having got these two, it will be meaningful to have some kind
of strategies to curtail the terrorists' global network and sympathisers.
Terrorism financing. From research and studies made by some regulatory
and investigating bodies, there is a distinct difference between AML
(Anti-Money Laundering) and CFT (Combating the Financing of Terrorism).
In AML, the owner or perpetrator hopes to make the illegal money legal,
and he wants to live longer to enjoy the wealth and funds. In CFT, the
owner or perpetrator does not care about the value of money, and he or
she does not intend to live to enjoy the funds. All that matters is that
a terrorist act can be executed, some lives or properties can be damaged
or destroyed to get public attention, or to avenge (act of revenge) his
or her anger or to fulfil/actualise his or her ideals or beliefs.
Financial intermediary. Banks or financial institutions usually focus
on the use or destination of the funds that may be derived from
legitimate sources. This places a burden upon a financial institution (as
the intermediary) that goes beyond its usual due diligence policies and
procedures. Assessing terrorism financing involves a risk assessment of
the use of the funds, as opposed to a business risk that a financial
institution usually employs. Today, financial institutions are required
to have a database of terrorist suspects as published or issued by the
regulators in the country. Many countries also have their competent FIU
or Financial Intelligent Unit that monitors and keeps documents and
records of money laundering and terrorism financing activities. If any
financial institution suspects that a transaction is terrorist-related,
it has to report such matter to the authority (FIU).
Even if there is no real evidence of a direct terrorist connection, if
such a transaction appears suspicious for other reasons whatsoever, such
transaction ought to be reported to the FIU under the suspicious
transaction report or STR. The FIU in each country co-operates with other
FIUs in other countries for information sharing. This kind of
co-operation is a good foundation for a global effort to fight money
laundering and terrorism financing internationally.
Inexpensive terrorism financing. These days, any likely terrorist
activities are not expensive to fund. Example: A successful terrorism act
could cost as dirt cheap as RM5, and this could be the cost of a
pen-knife that a hijacker could use to threaten and stab an airline
pilot. With this RM5 investment cost (plus his portion of the airfare),
that terrorist would have been successful in his/her mission to create
fear, terror and receive public attention worldwide. She/he would have
been successful in affecting, say, the 200-odd passengers in the airplane
that she/he hijacks.
Partners in combating terrorism financing. Who are the partners in the
fight against terrorism in any country? They can be the intelligence unit
of the regulators, the police, customs, immigration, religious
institutions, educational institutions, NGOs and the common man on the
street.
It is in fact every body's responsibility, and we all need to work in
that partnership if we would like to see peace, stability, safety and
security in this universal planet called earth that we inhabit and value
as our abode.
Reverse money-laundering by terrorism operations. Terrorist groups do
not do money-laundering. They could be said to do the ""reverse of
money-laundering"". That is, they use good money to make that money bad or
illegal.
The main aim of terrorist perpetrators is in spreading their ideology
and political mileages. They want public and global attention to their
plight. They use clean money for their ""dirty"" activities. Their
intention or desire is to change or shape the world order and societal
mindset/cultures into the ways of their cultures/social or religious
orders.
At the meantime, the people involved in money laundering obtain the
dirty or laundered money first and beat the authorities by flouting the
law. Later, they would want to cleanse or make this money ""good"" by
placing and mixing them with their money that had been obtained from
legitimate sources. Then they will enjoy or use this laundered money to
expand their operations or to acquire the necessities and luxuries in
life for their consumption and enjoyment.
Intellectual property crime. Launderers and terrorist groups have
options or multiple funding sources. One source of money-funding may be
from proceeds of intellectual property crime or IPC. The funds from IPC
might be from either their direct involvement in the IPC; or via indirect
commitment where their sympathisers or supporters send the IPC funds to
the terrorist groups' central funds or directly fund their cell groups'
activities.
The conduit between counterfeit goods and organised crime is usually
established. From past seizures by the authorities, there are evidences
to substantiate the IPC linkages to terrorist groups and their
fund-raising activities.
Adopting 360 degree proactive strategy. Selected organisations (and
banks especially) often represent the dual target of the terrorist
ideology. Therefore, a 360-degree proactive strategy to combat
terrorism-financing is good. Such 360-degree strategy can be carried out
by:
* Preventing or denying the ability of terrorist to gain access to
funds physically, technically, and or via any form of business employee
partner.
* Curbing the ability of terrorists to use financial systems to fund
their activities or network.
* Nabbing the clients, for example, know who are introducing the money
or putting funds into the financial system.
* Ticking off the employees, for example, identify who are managing or
transacting/processing the money.
* Identifying the business partner, for example, recognise who are
paying to service the business.
Performing the above 360-degree or complete turnaround surveillance
checking can deny terrorists' ability to further their activities. They
will not then be able to cause damage or influence/control an
organisation's (example financial institution) employees and systems.
Transnational organised crime or TNOC. What is transnational organised
crime or TNOC? The United Nations Convention against TNOC defines
organised criminal group to mean ""a structured group of three or more
persons existing for a period of time and acting in concert with the aim
of committing one or more serious crimes or offences established pursuant
to this Convention, in order to obtain, directly, or indirectly, a
financial or other material benefit"".
United Nations' classification of TNOC. In broad term, the types of
transnational organised crimes that the United Nations commonly refer to
are the following:
* Illicit drug-trafficking
* Smuggling of illegal immigrants
* Arms trafficking and arms-deals
* Trafficking in nuclear material
* Terrorism and transnational organised triads or syndicates
* Money-laundering
* Trafficking in human body parts
* Burglary and smuggling of vehicles
* Others like burglary or arts/materials, corruption, computer,
environmental, and intellectual property crimes.
Core factors of TNOC in a country. What are two glaring drivers or
factors of transnational organised crime in any country? These are the i)
external factor, and the ii) internal factor.
i) External factor. Neighbouring countries are still conducting illegal
businesses and using the country as a by-pass. How is this to be halted
or prevented from coming into the country depends a lot on the laws in
the country, and how the enforcement efforts are stepped up, as well as
the manner in which exports or the purchases of the products and services
from the illegal businesses by the neighbouring countries are curbed or
prevented by the country.
ii) Internal factor. The elements to manage here will be criminals who
disguise themselves as tourists and operate in the country during their
stay as tourists. It is hard to nab them, unless they have a record with
notorious negative publicity worldwide. The other element will be the
corruptions of officials in the country involving massive frauds and
abuses of public or organisational assets and properties.
To avert these elements from mushrooming or taking shape internally in
a country, it is necessary to have up-to-date development of
international as well as domestic communication so that data and
information on the specific individuals are available in a timely manner
so that regulators and law enforcers like customs check point, the
police, and immigration check-point can refer to and make full use of.

"Man charged with money laundering
PETALING JAYA: A businessman was charged in the Sessions Court yesterday
with three counts of laundering a total of RM768,847.83.
S.M. Segaran, 44, managing director of Bidara Prisma Sdn Bhd, was
alleged to have laundered the illegally gained proceeds in three
transactions through CIMB Bank Berhad at Wisma Consplant in Subang Jaya,
between May 24 and July 3 last year.
Clad in a navy blue jacket with matching striped shirt, Segaran, who
pleaded not guilty, was calm when the charges were read to him.
Deputy public prosecutor Rahimah Abdul Majid proposed RM200,000 bail
for all three charges.
Segaran's counsel, Surjan Singh Sidhu, pleaded for a lower amount and
said that his client had cooperated with the authorities throughout the
investigations last year.
He also applied for the title deed of a house to be deposited instead
of cash.
""The market value of the house, which is located in Subang Jaya, is
currently RM410,000,"" said Surjan.
Judge Balqis Aini Mohd Ali granted Segaran RM50,000 bail in one surety
and allowed the title deed to be deposited in lieu of cash.
She fixed Nov 17 for mention of the case.
On July 29, Segaran was charged at the Kuala Lumpur Sessions Court with

federal police headquarters in Bukit Aman, by supplying imitation spare
parts worth more than RM1.1 million.
The items consisted of 67 Proton and 13 Mitsubishi spare parts for
police cars.
Segaran was alleged to have deceived officers in the department into
believing that the parts were genuine.
He claimed trial and was released on RM90,000 bail for all the charges.

"Money laundering scam: 143 Nigerians detained
Source:New Straits Times
KUALA LUMPUR, Fri. - Police launched four operations in the Klang Valley
and six States between August and early this month to round up 143
Nigerians believed to be actively involved in fraud.
Of the 143, nine are being detained under the Internal Security Act.
The majority of detainees are being held at the Semenyih and Macap Umboo
Immigration camps for illegal immigrants in Selangor and Malacca
respectively.
Two of them are being held at the Sungai Buloh prison.
Announcing the swoop today, Federal police Criminal Investigations
Department director Datuk Ismail Che Rus said with the arrests, police
believe they have busted a six-year-old syndicate.
Police have received 100 complaints from the public on the activities of
the syndicate, which would deceive their victims by pledging to pay
commissions if they were to participate in non-existent money laundering
activities.
In the past three months, police received five reports from five
businessmen - four foreigners and a local - alleging they had been cheated
of RM2.5 million by the syndicate.
Ismail told a Press conference at the Federal police headquarters in
Bukit Aman that the breakthrough in its investigations came through a
report lodged by a victim in Langkawi in August this year.
Following the report, a Nigerian who was a holder of a Zimbabwean
passport under the name of Tichaona Tinet Siketha Bahle-Mwamuha was picked
up on Aug 29.
The suspect was alleged to have attempted to offer a local businessman a
chance to transfer US$27 million (about RM100 million) from an ""over-
invoiced"" Nigerian Government contract into his local bank account.
The businessman was told to pay a stamp duty amounting to US$26,000
(RM96,200) before the cash could be transferred into his account.
Suspecting something amiss, he lodged a police report.
Following the arrest, police picked up two Nigerian students of a
private college here on Sept 13.
Investigations revealed that all three were members of a syndicate which
had used Kuala Lumpur as their centre of operations.
The students entered the country with student visas.
""This syndicate was not only involved in non-existent money laundering
activities like the advance fees fraud, but also in cheating banks by
using fake bank drafts.""
The Federal police, with the collaboration of its State branches decided
to launch a nationwide swoop.
Codenamed Ops Baki, Ismail said, the first phase was launched in the
Klang Valley on Nov 13.
A total of 125 Nigerians were rounded up and 25 subsequently released.
Of the remainder, 13 were arrested under the ISA including the
mastermind (four were subsequently released), 67 held at the Semenyih
camp, 18 at the Macap Umboocamp and two at the Sungai Buloh prison.
The second phase of the operation was launched between Dec 4 and 6.
Police teams swooped down on suspected homes, colleges and offices of
the Nigerians in Kedah, Penang, Selangor, Johor, Pahang and here.
The swoop netted 107 Nigerians. Of this number, 44 were detained.
The syndicate picked their victims using the Yellow Pages, newspapers
and business organisations before following up with a letter or fax their
target with a forged letterhead of the Federal Republic of Nigeria's Debt
Reconciliation Committee or the Central Bank of Nigeria.
The syndicate member would then offer the victim a 30 per cent
commission from an ""excess-fund"" from the CBN.
This was provided that the businessman is willing to co-operate with the
syndicate and allow them to use his banking facilities to transfer the
money out of the bank.
Ismail said 60 per cent of the proceeds would go to the syndicate and 10
per cent to process the claims.
""If there was a positive response from the victim, a meeting will be
set, usually in hotels in the Klang Valley.
""During the meeting, the victims will be briefed on the deal and after
being convinced, they will be asked to sign several documents,"" said
Ismail.
The victims will have to bear the cost of the transactions including
stamp duties, insurance, handling fees and a government tax called the
National Economic Reconstruction Fund Tax.
The tax is said to be around US$10,000 to US$15,000.
Ismail urged businessmen who had fallen victim to the syndicate to lodge
police reports soon.

"Zeti: Remain vigilant against money laundering
Source:New Straits Times
BANK Negara Governor Datuk Dr Zeti Akhtar Aziz has warned that money
laundering and the need for proper controls to prevent it are not confined
to banks as any financial service provider can be used as a vehicle.
""To effectively combat money laundering, the whole financial system has
to be vigilant and work together,"" she said in her welcoming remarks at
the opening of the fourth annual meeting of the Asia/Pacific Group on
Money Laundering in Kuala Lumpur yesterday. It was opened by Finance
Minister Tun Daim Zainuddin.
Recognising the need to have a co-ordinated effort in the fight, the
National Co-ordination Committee to Counter Money Laundering was set up
involving 13 Ministries and Government agencies as its members with Bank
Negara as the lead agency.
It provides a forum for co-ordinating national anti-money laundering
strategies and policies in the country as well as developing national
policies and measures to counter money laundering.
Bank Negara, she added, has introduced a number of initiatives to
counter money laundering. Among them are guidelines issued to prevent
banking institutions from being used as a conduit for money laundering.
Last month, the central bank also issued ""Guidelines on Anti-Money
Laundering Measures for the Insurance Industry"" requiring insurance
intermediaries to put in place controls to counter money laundering.
""With the enactment of the Anti-Money Laundering Bill 2001, the
reporting requirements and obligations in the guidelines would have the
force of law.
""Financial institutions have to put in place more stringent and
efficient measures and mechanisms to fight against laundering.""
Zeti said it is imperative that the banking industry be vigilant to
ensure that all efforts of the money launderer are thwarted.
Money launderers are swift in probing the financial system for
vulnerabilities and using their ingenuity to devise new methods to
circumvent the system and adapt their methods to exploit these
vulnerabilities.
Offshore financial centres, she said, have been the focus of the
international community as they are vulnerable to open to abuse by money
launderers.
""The Labuan Offshore Financial Services Authority (Lofsa) will
continually assess and upgrade the legal and supervisory framework to
ensure that it is on par with the latest international supervisory
requirements.""
To preserve Labuan's image as a reputable offshore centre conducive for
quality players and genuine players, it has a stringent policy of
admitting only reputable and full-fledged players to Labuan.
On Labuan's assessment, she said an evaluation team comprising
evaluators from the Asia-Pacific Group on Money Laundering and the
Offshore Group of Banking Supervisors has met with the respective
Ministries and Government agencies and the Labuan offshore players.
She described the three-day meeting as important as it brings about a
better understanding of, and action against, money laundering and promotes

"Separate money laundering law for Labuan IOFC
Source:New Straits Times
A separate money laundering legislation for the Labuan International
Offshore Financial Centre (IOFC) will be introduced soon, Finance Minister
Tun Daim Zainuddin said yesterday.
The move was to preserve Labuan's image as a credible and reputable IOFC
which is able to withstand the most intense of scrutiny.
Speaking at the launching of the annual Labuan Lecture Series 2000 in
Labuan, Daim said the proposed legislation was distinctively different
from the one being considered for the domestic market.
""The legislation for Labuan will better suit the nature of the offshore
industries,"" he said.
Speaking at a Press conference later, Daim said the introduction of the
legislation did not mean that there were cases of money laundering
involving international financial institutions.
""It is more of a preventive measure,"" he said.
The draft for the proposed law was being prepared and was expected to be
approved next year.
Daim said it was the Government's hope to attract the world's top
financial players to take advantage of the Labuan IOFC.
On Brunei's proposal to establish an IOFC, Daim said it should not be
seen as a threat or competitor to the Labuan IOFC.
""We (Labuan IOFC) are far ahead of them ... but we need to co-exist,""
Daim said.
Labuan Offshore Financial Services Authority (LOFSA) director-general
Mohd Razif Abdul Kadir, who was also at the Press conference, said there
was no need to worry about Brunei's IOFC plan.
""What was important is for LOFSA to make the Labuan IOFC innovative,
competitive and with the capacity to stay ahead of the others,"" Mohd Razif
said.
Stressing that LOFSA will continue to work to add depth and value into
business in Labuan, Daim said new projects, products and services would be
introduced.
He was pleased to note that one of the initiatives, the International
Islamic Financial Market (IIFM) spearheaded by LOFSA had received
favourable response from the Islamic Development Bank and other Islamic
countries.
Daim said a working group meeting comprising representatives from
various Islamic countries to discuss IIFM in Labuan on Tuesday made
significant progress.
As one of the key Islamic financial centres in the world, LOFSA is
setting up a Syariah Advisory Council to provide assistance and advice in
development of Islamic financial products and services.
In conjunction with the Lecture Series, Daim launched the Labuan IOFC
10th Anniversary Commemorative book which depicted Labuan's rapid

"The hype in money laundering
Source:New Straits Times
OVER the past few years, corporate management of organisations have
become very hyped about the issue of money laundering and terrorism
financing. This is because regulators and law makers all over the world
have tightened their anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-financing of
terrorism (CFT) laws.
Violating or non complying with such laws or Acts will see individuals
and organisations facing severe criminal and punitive sentences.
The need for such stern moves by the regulators and governments
throughout the world is commendable; given the fact that frauds,
corruptions, sabotages, terrorisms, unlawful business transactions or
illicit and illegal activities are becoming alarming in today's world.
Better world order, peace, global harmony and civil societies in all
countries are envisaged if the compliance with AML and CFT are in place.
Financial intermediaries like banking and financial institutions and
insurance companies are governed heavily by AML and CFT. In Malaysia of
late, besides these institutions, professional firms that avail
professional services like legal firms, financial advisers, and
accounting and auditing firms are also required to comply with the AML
and CFT and to implement their know-your-customer (KYC) programme well.
Severe penalties can impact those firms that do not comply.
Mind-boggling sum of money laundering. To let us have a feel of how
financially monstrous this money laundering activity is, we can learn
from an International Monetary Fund survey done in year 2003. It revealed
that some US$1.5 trillion (RM5.58 trillion) is laundered annually around
the world. The risk that the public sector faces is the unacceptable
crime levels.
Illicit financial flows have prompted the regulators to ensure that the
financial institutions, and firms that avail accounting and legal
services need to observe strict AML/CFT filtering and censure. This IMF
report also highlighted that the more common forms of money laundering
are drug trafficking, organised crime, financial frauds, and terrorism.
Predicated offences. One's knowledge of money laundering and financing
terrorism is enhanced if one is aware of the predicated offences that are
described in the AML/CFT Act. We shall look at some of the predicated
offences below.
a) Organised crimes activities. Organised crimes often always indulge
in money-laundering business. These crimes instill fear, terror and
upheavals. Their deeds are menaces to any society.
Some of the organised crime-linked business or financial activities are
as follows:
* Murder
* Extortion, blackmail, hijacking n Kidnapping and ransom
* Identify thieving
* Bribery and corruption
* Forgery of currencies
* Cigarette and alcohol smuggling
* Human trafficking, vice den, massage parlour operations
* Smuggling, prohibited and contraband goods
* Counterfeit goods, brands/labels and products
* Infringement of IPRs (intellectual property rights, pirated CDs, etc)
* Customs duty and excise evasions
* Armed heist and robbery
* Terrorism and public disorder/fear
* Credit card frauds
* Drug trafficking
b) Common types of predicated offences. Related to the organised
crimes' activities mentioned above, the following are some of the common
predicated offences generally undertaken by money-launders and

"Money laundering vulnerability low
Source:New Straits Times
LABUAN has a low vulnerability to money laundering risks compared to other
offshore financial centres in the world due to the high-quality investment
funds involved.
Sydney-based Asia-Pacific Group on Money Laundering secretariat head
Rick Mcdonell said solid and reputable international banks have
investments in Labuan.
""That kind of activity does not take place in Labuan as in the case of
some Caribbean or Pacific island states,"" he said to reporters after the
fourth annual meeting of the APG in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.
Offshore financial centres have been the focus of the international
community as they are vulnerable to being abused by money launderers.
Money launderers look for places where regulation and banking secrecy
laws are less stringent.
On Labuan's assessment, Mcdonell said details of the evaluation could
not be discussed.
""A number of recommendations have been put forward (by the assessment
team) to improve things in Labuan although the regulatory controls in
Labuan have reduced money laundering risks compared with the other
centres.""
A team comprising evaluators from the Asia-Pacific Group on Money
Laundering and the Offshore Group of Banking Supervisors had met the
respective ministries and government agencies and the Labuan offshore
players.
The Labuan Offshore Financial Services Authority (LOFSA) has been
continually assessing and upgrading the legal and supervisory framework
for the IOFC to ensure that it is at par with the latest international
supervisory requirements.
Bank Negara deputy governor Datuk Huang Sin Cheng said there has been no
reported money laundering problem in Malaysia.
""Although Parliament passed the Anti-Money Laundering Act 2001 earlier
this month this does not imply the country is facing money laundering
problems.
""There have been a lot of provisions already built into our legislation
including the anti-corruption and anti-narcotics as well as banking
guidelines.
""In most places today, money laundering is seen as an issue for
financial markets, as well as criminal justice systems, raising questions
about governance, anti-corruption measures, reputation and financial
stability.
""To move forward, many jurisdictions now involve central banks, finance
and justice ministries and law enforcement agencies in their strategies to
address the issues.""
Huang, who co-chaired the meeting with Australian National Crime
have joined the growing membership.
Apart from Labuan, three other mutual evaluations of member
jurisdictions - Samoa, Chinese Taipei and Macau - have been completed. The
evaluation is part of the membership requirement.
Crooke described money laundering as an enormous enterprise and global
in nature as it involves the transfer of funds from small to big
countries.
During the three-day meeting, there were 200 participants representing
22 member jurisdictions, 16 observer jurisdictions and 13 international
and regional organisations.

"296 money-laundering charges, yet he's so cool
KUALA LUMPUR: For a man charged with 296 counts of money-laundering - the
highest number of charges ever faced by one person - Daniel Choong Yew
Chee looked every inch the star at the Sessions Court yesterday.
Dressed in a dark suit and sporting a purple tie and blond ponytail,
Choong, the director of G-Gold Gallery Sdn Bhd, seemed unfazed by the
attention of photographers as he greeted them and calmly walked into the
courtroom accompanied by his lawyers.
The 40-year-old, who was charged yesterday with laundering a total of
RM54 million of illegal proceeds, claimed trial to all charges.
This was in addition to the 94 similar charges involving RM23.3 million
slapped against him at the Ipoh Sessions Court on Monday, to which he had
also claimed trial.
Choong may face up to five years' jail or RM5 million fine or both if
found guilty under the Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorism Financing
Act 2001.
Proceedings, which began yesterday before Judge Rozana Ali Yusuff at
1pm, ended at 2.20pm after court interpreters took an hour to read out
all the charges.
Choong allegedly transferred illegally obtained cash to several
companies, including G-Vest Corp Sdn Bhd, Genius Talents Sdn Bhd, M & A
Securities Sdn Bhd, PM Securities Sdn Bhd, Affin Securities Sdn Bhd and
SBB Securities Sdn Bhd.
The offences were committed at the G-Gold Gallery office between
December 2004 and May 2006.
Deputy public prosecutor Budiman Lutfi Mohamed proposed RM2 million as
bail based on the number of the charges and the amount involved.
He also asked that Choong's passport be surrendered to the court.
Counsel Gurbachan Singh asked for bail to be set at RM500,000 as Choong
had cooperated during investigations.
""Choong was in Australia last week on business but returned to Malaysia
when Bank Negara called him. He also surrendered himself to police here
and in Ipoh.""
Gurbachan added that Choong's passport had already been surrendered to
the Ipoh Sessions Court.
Rozana allowed bail at RM1 million in one surety and set Aug 12 for
mention. She also ordered that Choong's passport be brought here should
the case in Ipoh conclude first.
Earlier, Choong claimed trial at another Sessions Court to two counts
of illegally collecting deposits of more than RM10 million.
These charges were under the Banking and Financial Institutions Act
1989.
Bank Negara prosecuting officer Anthony Kularaj Kulasingam said the
prosecution would call about 35 witnesses to testify in the trial.
Judge S.M. Komathy Suppiah allowed bail at RM500,000 in one surety and
set Aug 12 for mention.
Choong posted bail.
Last Thursday, another G-Gold Gallery director, Khoo Ban Sean, 62, was
charged at the Ipoh Sessions Court with 94 counts of money laundering
involving RM23.3 million.
He claimed trial to all charges.

"police officer charged with money laundering

JOHOR BARU: Superintendent Azmi Osman yesterday earned the dubious
distinction of being the first police officer to be charged with money
laundering.
The former chief of Johor's anti-vice, gaming and secret society
division was accused of receiving ill-gotten gains totalling RM1.263
million through money laundering.
The 52-year-old officer, currently attached to the Internal Security
and Public Order division at the federal police headquarters in Bukit
Aman, claimed trial to all three counts under the Anti-Money Laundering
and Anti-Terrorism Finance Act 2001.
The offences were allegedly committed between Aug 19, 2003 and April 5,
2005 at the Malayan Banking Berhad's City Square branch at Jalan Wong Ah
Fook here.
On the first charge, Azmi was alleged to have received RM71,870.70
which was deposited into his Maybank account on Aug 19, 2003.
On the second charge, Azmi was alleged to have received a total of
RM941,930 between Jan 13, 2004 and Nov 17, 2004.
On April 5, 2005, he allegedly received in the same way, a further
RM200,000.
Azmi, who faces a maximum five-year jail term or RM5 million fine or
both if convicted, appeared calm throughout the proceedings.
DPP Zulkifli Ahmad proposed bail at RM200,000 for all three charges but
Azmi's counsel, C.N. Sritharan pleaded for a lesser amount saying his
client had heart problems and had been on sick leave since last
Wednesday.
""He has a wife and five schoolgoing children. He is forced to bear the
shame of being charged and also has financial problems after his current
and savings account, and shares were frozen following two confiscation
orders against him in August 2005 and December 2006.""
Zulkifli, however, argued that hospital authorities had confirmed that
Azmi only suffered chest pains and not a heart attack.
""All the money and property that had been frozen are for use as
evidence. He is still receiving his monthly salary,"" Zulkifli said.
Judge Zanol Rashid Hussain set bail at RM200,000 with one surety and
fixed Oct 31 for the mention.
Azmi, who posted bail, is expected to face two further counts of money
laundering in Temerloh, Pahang today. The sum involved in those cases are
said to be about RM4 million.

"`Uniform laws against money laundering needed'
Source:New Straits Times
KUALA LUMPUR, Mon. - Asia-Pacific countries should work closely to come up
with a law that will effectively curb money laundering by dadah
traffickers.
Deputy Home Minister Datuk Tajol Rosli Mohd Ghazali said today it was
pointless for a country to have laws enabling it to seize the assets of
dadah traffickers if other countries did not have laws on money
laundering.
He said although Malaysia had a law on the seizure of such assets, it
was important for other countries in the region to have similar laws.
""The differing laws have enabled dadah traffickers to exploit the
loopholes to escape prosecution and reap the benefits of their illegal
activities.
""This is something that needs to be seriously addressed so that these
people do not get away by merely crossing international borders. This can
be done through extradition treaties and seizure of assets.""
Tajol Rosli was speaking to reporters after opening the 22nd Meeting of
Heads of Asia and Pacific National Drug Laws Enforcement Agencies.
He also said the police would track down the mastermind behind the
illegal assemblies being organised in support of the Reformasi movement as
it was detrimental to the stability of the country.

RM37 million, a doctor was in the dock of a Sessions Court facing a
similar charge involving US$1,126,607.50 (RM4,275,475.46).
Dr Hamimah Idruss, 55, who was the first person to be charged under the
new Anti-Money Laundering Act, is alleged to have received the money which
were proceeds from illegal activities, through the account of Megbridge
Sdn Bhd at an OCBC Bank in Damansara Utama on June 10, last year.
The offence is punishable with a fine up to RM5 million, or jail of up
to five years, or both.
The charge today was an addition to those preferred at the Kuala Lumpur
Sessions Court last Friday.
With the new charge, Dr Hamimah faces a total of eight charges of money
laundering involving US$10,889,999 (RM41,337,-727.11).
Dr Hamimah who was clad in a dark long skirt, a white blouse, dark

Kuala Lumpur.
Previously, it was reported that the alleged illegal activities which
resulted in the proceeds were believed to be cheating and forgery of
documents. She has yet to be charged with the two offences.
Deputy Public Prosecutor Dzulkifli Ahmad asked the court to impose a
bail of RM200,000 in one surety saying that it was an appropriate amount
since the offence was non-bailable and serious.

Judge Nurmala Salim fixed bail at RM150,000 with one surety and ordered

"Retrial in money laundering case
KUALA LUMPUR: Dr Hamimah Idruss, the first person to be charged under the
Anti-Money Laundering Act, will be retried.
She was initially charged in April 2004 with eight counts of receiving
money, which were proceeds from unlawful activities overseas, totalling
US$10 million (RM41.33 million).
But after a trial which lasted five years, in which 45 witnesses
testified, the case was ordered to be retried yesterday.
Sessions Court Judge S.M. Komathy made the order as the judge at the
previous trial, Akhtar Tahir, had been promoted to judicial commissioner.
She fixed May 27 to hear the case.
Dr Hamimah, the former director of Safire Pharmaceuticals (Malaysia)
Sdn Bhd, was first charged with seven counts of receiving the money
through several bank accounts in 2003.
Four days later, she was charged at the Petaling Jaya Sessions Court
with a similar charge involving US$1,126,607.50.
The cases were transferred to the Sessions Court here for a joint
trial. The illegal activities were linked to cheating and forgery of
documents.
Dr Hamimah claimed trial and was granted RM800,000 bail with two
sureties.
She also faced another 10 charges of abetting her former employee,
Yusaini Wan Abi Sabian, 35, in falsifying promissory notes amounting to
US$12 million.
It was reported that some of the promissory notes had been issued and
sold overseas, including in London. Some were bought by Siemens Financial

"Proposal to set up unit to curb money laundering
Source:New Straits Times
KUALA LUMPUR, Wed. - The setting up of a financial intelligence unit or
FIU in all Asean countries to curb money laundering activities, which were
traditionally related to drug-trafficking but have now been linked to
terrorists activities too, was proposed today.
Home Ministry deputy secretary-general (security) Datuk Shafee Abu Bakar
said FIU would serve as the focal point for co-ordination of anti-money
laundering measures.
""There has to be a focused, concerted and multi-pronged approach in
combating the menace of money-laundering,"" he said at the closing of the
three-day Asean Anti-Money Laundering Workshop here today.
He said efforts would have to be undertaken to strengthen the legal and
regulatory framework, enhance law enforcement and increase the capacity of
participating countries if they wish to succeed.
Asean, he added, was unique in the sense there were different
traditions, cultures and customs resulting in each member country adopting
its own legal standards and forms.
""There is a need to establish a working group and networking to
facilitate consultation among member countries. The focus of consultation
could be to set up a database that collates the different laws,
agreements, treaties and memorandums of understanding of Asean countries.""
He said the database would not only assist member countries in research
work but also be used as a benchmark against international antimoney
laundering standards.
""This paves the way for development of a comprehensive legal framework
in Asean countries,"" he said, adding that law enforcement would only be
effective if the information gathered was reliable and from good and
quality sources.
He said a single entity established for the purpose of gathering and co-
ordination of intelligence would be the ideal way of ensuring information
on money laundering activities within Asean was shared among member
countries.
""The FIU's could meet on a regular basis with a view to streamlining
anti-money laundering measures. MoUs could provide the basis for co-
operation such as freezing of assets,"" Shafee said.
He also said that their efforts on anti-money laundering would be
realised only with the co-operation of the banking, financial community
and members of the society.

The APEC officials will promote a high-level political dialogue to

SHAH ALAM, July 1 (Bernama) -- An inmate of a drug rehabilitation centre was
sent to the gallows by the High Court here today after he was found guilty of
murdering a colleague at the centre four years ago.
In his ruling, judge Mohd Yazid Mustafa said the defence had failed to raise
any reasonable doubts on the prosecution's case.
D.Muthu, 33, a former labourer, was charged with murdering Song Chan
Seng, 43, at the parade ground of the Kajang Rehabilitation Centre about 5.05pm
on July 28, 2006.
In his judgment, Mohd Yazid said Muthu was 29-years-old at the time the
offence was committed and was sent to the rehabilitation centre in June 2006 for
his addiction to heroin since he was 20-years-old.
He said in the defence, Muthu denied having any misunderstanding with Song
nor did he attack the victim with a sharp object.
However, Mohd Yazid said, the prosecution witnesses testified they saw Muthu
approaching Song and then stabbed him  before running towards a rehabilitation
officer there.
""About 10 inmates who witnessed the incident went after him and scuffle
broke out.
""I accept the testimony by the prosecution witness that the murder weapon,
an iron rod, was seized from the accused in the scuffle.
""The incident happened during the day and in an open space. I am satisfied
that there was no obstruction at all for witness to see the incident and weapon
used in the murder was with the accused,"" he added.
Mohd Yazid said although there was no stains found on the weapon or blood
stains found on the piece of white cloth used to wrap the weapon, the court
found that Muthu used it to stab Song.
""I accept the testimony by the prosecution witnesses who were near the scene
and saw the accused used the weapon to stab the victim. Considering all the
evidence, I found that the act of stabbing the victim and the extent of injury
inflicted on the victim, the accused had intent to kill.
""Apart from that, the intention to kill was also evident with the
preparation made by the accused in carrying the weapon and then fleeing the
scene after stabbing the victim.
""Hence, I found that the prosecution had succeeded in proving the case
beyond reasonable doubts and the accused is found guilty and sentenced to death

"MURDER SUSPECT SHOT DEAD BY POLICE
POLICE-SHOOTING
KUALA LUMPUR, April 2 (Bernama) -- A murder suspect hunted by police for
the last three days for killing a taxi driver was shot dead early this morning
in a shootout right in the heart of the city.
Selangor police chief, Datuk Khalid Abu Bakar, said in the 3.45am incident,
the suspect, Muhisbudin Isumumin, 42, from Aceh, Indonesia, believed to be the
mastermind in the murder, was shot dead near Wisma Safuan, Kampung Periuk, in
an exchange of fire with police.
Six other suspects were also arrested in the nearby Kampung Baru area.
Earlier, police had raided a location in Kampung Baru after detecting all
seven suspects but the mastermind slipped through the police cordon.
Police trailed him for several metres and a shootout erupted leading to the
suspect being shot dead.
""Following the successful operation, police seized two semi-automatic
pistols and a revolver from them,"" Khalid told reporters when met at the scene
later.
He said a police corporal was injured after being shot in his right hand
during the incident and was sent to the Kuala Lumpur Hospital for treatment.
On Wednesday, an Indonesian taxi driver who had permanent residency, Anuar
Ahmad, in his 30s, was found dead with shots to his head and abdomen.
His body found in a drain at Km8.5 Jalan Bristol in Kuang, Rawang.
Less than 24 hours later, his second wife, Sariningsih Nilam, 35, became a
target of the suspects when she was shot twice in her abdomen at close range
near the Department of Orang Asli Affairs Hospital in Gombak.
Sariningsih survived and is being treated at the Selayang Hospital where
her condition is reported to be stable.
Khalid said police were still investigating the motive for the taxi
driver's slaying and the wounding of his wife.
However, he did not rule out the possibility the incidents had something to
do with a drug distribution syndicate.

fugitive who went into hiding in India about 10 years ago before his capture
last month by Tamil Nadu police, will be charged here next week for the murder
of a compatriot.
Soosai, 47, will face a charge of killing lorry driver N. Subramaniam in

The killing was triggered by a family matrimonial altercation.
""All the court processes are going on, Soosai will be charged in a week's

It is learnt the police have initiated further investigations on the alleged
criminal activities of Soosai who was captured in a hotel in Chennai early last
month, along with his wife, Rajeswari.
When police raided his house in the state of Andhra Pradesh recently -- from
where he was said to have conducted cross-border scams -- investigators
unearthed more falsified documents.
""We found three birth certificates belonging to his children, all falsely
created. These documents were from the Hyderabad Municipal Authority but upon

PUTRAJAYA, Nov 2 (Bernama) -- A policeman will have a date with the hangman
as
the Federal Court today rejected his final appeal to set aside his conviction
and death sentence for the murder of the lead singer of the 'Spoon' rock
group, 11 years ago.
Chief Justice Tun Zaki Azmi, who led a panel of three judges, unanimously
upheld the Seremban High Court decision which found Lance Corporal Mohamed
Ya'cob Demyati guilty of murdering Sabi'ul Malik Shafiee, popularly known as
Along, and sentenced him to death.
The other two judges were Federal Court judges Datuk Seri Md Raus Sharif and
Datuk Abdull Hamid Embong.
When Abdull Hamid delivered the verdict, Mohamed Ya'cob, 44, was a picture
of
calm.
He said the high court judge was not misled when accepting the information
from
Mohamed Ya'cob which led to the discovery of Along's body at KM28 Jalan Kuala
Klawang Genting Peras.
Apart from that information, Abdull Hamid said there was also circumstantial
evidence to conclude that Mohamed Ya'cob -- attached to the Kuala Lumpur police
headquarters -- murdered Along.
He said there was evidence to show that Mohamed Ya'cob was the last person
to be with the deceased, adding that a prosecution witness, Mohd Fadzil Mohd
Yatim, said he was asked by the accused to leave both of them (Mohamed Ya'cob
and Along) at the location where the body was later found.
Apart from that, Abdull Hamid said, evidence showed that Mohamed Ya'cob had
loudly questioned the deceased several times on his (Along's) relationship with
his (Mohamed Ya'cob's) wife.
Mohamed Ya'cob, who was a personal bodyguard to the 10th and 11th Yang

KM28 Jalan Kuala Klawang-Genting Peras, Jelebu on Dec 26, 1999.

COURT-MUNTIK
SHAH ALAM, March 4 (Bernama) -- The High Court here was today told that
sugarcane seller A. Murugan's house at Taman Sentosa, Klang, was broken into
when he was in remand to assist police investigations into the death of
Indonesian maid, Muntik Bani.
Investigating Officer ASP Ahmad Tarmudi, 47, from the Klang district police,
said the break-in was realised when he went to the house on Nov 3 last year
together with Murugan's wife, D.Vanitha, and a policewoman.
""When we reached the house, it was in a mess. I knew the house had been
broken into based on the broken ceiling. There was a report lodged on the
break-in by his relatives,"" he said when questioned by deputy public prosecutor
Idham
Abd.Ghani at the hearing of Muntik Bani's murder case.
Murugan, 35, is alleged to have murdered Muntik, 40, at house No: 11, Jalan
Datuk Yusof Shahbudin 6, Taman Sentosa, Klang, between Oct 18 and 20 last year.
He is charged under Section 302 of the Penal Code and faces the mandatory
death sentence, if convicted.
Muntik, who was from Surabaya, died at the hospital in Klang on Oct 26
Questioned by Idham on his reason for going to the house, Ahmad said he went
there to investigate the crime scene and to get documents on Murugan's son,
M.Thirukumaran.
Earlier, Ahmad, who is the 50th prosecution witness, said he was instructed
by the Klang Crime Investigation division head, acting DSP Ruslan Ibrahim, to
take over investigation of the case from investigating officer Inspector Mohd
Azan Radzali on Oct 26 last year.
Idham : When you were appointed the investigating officer on Oct 26, why did
you wait until Nov 3 to go to the accused's house?
Ahmad : The accused's house had been visited by Inspector Azan and the
forensic expert from Bukit Aman had also taken some case items from the house.
Ahmad said that on Oct 26, he was with forensic expert, Dr Norliza Ibrahim,
to conduct a post-mortem on Muntik's body, which finished at 11pm, and then to
handle the sending back of the body to Indonesia.
""I also had to identify the witnesses at the hospital, like doctors who
treated Muntik, and record their statements.
""I had to also investigate areas in the vicinity of Murugan's house for
neighbours who could testify as well as at Muntik's former employer's house.
""All these I did from Oct 26 until Nov 3. I was also called by the Crime
Investigation department director and the Attorney-general to brief them on the
case,"" he added.

"THERE SHOULD BE NO TRIAL BY MEDIA IN SOSILAWATI MURDER CASE - NAZRI
NAZRI-SOSILAWATI
SHAH ALAM, Oct 4 (Bernama) -- There should be no trial by the media against
suspects in the murder of cosmetics millionaire Datuk Sosilawati Lawiya and
three others, said Minister in the Prime Minister's Department Datuk Seri
Mohamed Nazri Abdul Aziz.
He said he did not want any public prosecution or persecution by the media
on
the case, as it would be unfair to make assumptions or hurl accusations at them.
""Once the issue is sensationalised in the media, the person being
investigated
would be viewed as guilty, although that may not (necessarily) be so.
""This person will then become a victim of media prosecution and face
undue presssure from the public,"" Mohamed Nazri told reporters after attending a
forum on freedom of speech with Universiti Teknologi Mara (UiTM) students at
UiTM near here today.
In reporting on the high-profile case, the minister urged the media to hold
fast to their ethics and the course of justice.
Asked to comment on the actions of several news organisations which ran
footage of the murder suspects without blurring their faces, he said it was the
responsibility of the media, and not the government, to regulate their own
content.
""We, in the government, would appreciate it if self-censorship is practised
by the media themselves because if we do it, it would be seen as blocking media
freedom,"" he said.
Sosilawati, 47, her driver Kamarudin Shansuddin, 44, CIMB Bank officer
from the Kampung Baru branch Noorhisham Mohammad, 38, and her personal lawyer
Ahmad Kamil Abdul Karim, 32, were reported missing since Aug 30 after going to
Banting to discuss an alleged land deal.
The police believe the four were murdered, their bodies burned and ashes
strewn
in nearby rivers.
Meanwhile, Nazri assured Malaysia Today blogger Raja Petra Raja Kamaruddin
that
he would be safe if he returned to Malaysia.
""Malaysia is not a 'banana republic' in that it could not give safety
assurance towards a witness of a case. I would prefer if Raja Petra comes back
to Malaysia and faces the charges against him, and plays the game, according to
the rules,"" he said.
Mohamed Nazri said it was up to the public to judge whether what Raja Petra
wrote was true or otherwise, but felt that the fugitive blogger should not make
things more difficult for the authorities to act on things.
""There is some good to it (Raja Petra's blog postings) because at least, the
MACC (Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission) can act on it if it's true.
""But, if you do things this way, people will get confused and it will make
it difficult for the MACC to do its work,"" he noted.
Raja Petra was arrested on Sept 12, 2008 as he was deemed a threat to
national security and the order to detain him under the Internal Security Act
(ISA) was issued on Sept 22, 2008.
On Nov 7, 2008, the Shah Alam High Court ordered the release of Raja Petra
from ISA detention after ruling that his two-year detention at the Kamunting
detention camp in Taiping was unlawful.

the prosecution's appeal against the acquittal of businessman Koh Kim Teck and
his two bodyguards on a charge of murdering a 14-year-old Chinese teenager in

The appeal was postponed several times as Koh, 58, failed to appear in court
after their acquittal on Sept 20, 2005.
On Aug 24, 2008, the Court of Appeal issued a warrant of arrest for Koh over
his failure to turn up for the appeal hearing.
Today, Justice Datuk Suriyadi Halim Omar, who sat with Justices Datuk Hassan

the bodyguards, Resty Agpalo, 40, and Mohamad Najib Zulkifli, 32, in the appeal.
The two bodyguards were present in court.
""The first motion is an application to adduce further evidence at the appeal
stage and the second is an application to strike out the prosecution's appeal on
the ground of abuse of the court process,"" counsel Gobind Singh Deo, for Resty
and Mohamad Najib, told the court.
The hearing of the prosecution's appeal was originally set for March 14,

The three were acquitted and discharged by the High Court on Sept 20, 2005,

They were accused of murdering Xu, then a student of Mutiara Grammar
International School, at a bungalow in Jalan Mengkuang off Jalan Ampang, Kuala

"MURDER CASE REMITTED TO HIGH COURT BECAUSE OF ERROR BY TRIAL JUDGE
Court-Murder
PUTRAJAYA, Jan 9 (Bernama) -- The Court of Appeal here today ordered an
eight-year-old murder case to be remitted to the Seremban High Court for
retrial after ruling that there were many misdirections by the trial judge.
It also set aside all the orders made by the High Court judge against
orcharge worker Omar Mohd Bashri, 32, who was ordered to be kept in custody
at the pleasure of the Yang Dipertuan Besar of Negeri Sembilan.
Justices Datuk Wira Mohd Ghazali Mohd Yusoff, Datuk Md Raus Sharif and
Datuk Heliliah Mohd Yusof were unanimous in their decision and ordered that
the case be mentioned before another judge on Monday.
On July 27 2002, the then Seremban High Court judge, Datuk Hashim
Yusoff, acquitted and discharged Omar of the offence at the end of the
defence case and ordered that he be held at the pleasure of the Negeri
Sembilan ruler.
Omar was charged with murdering his cousin, Abdul Hamid Isa, 32, at a
durian orchard at the back of his house in Kampung Gebuk Mantin, Seremban,
at about 6.15pm on July 23 1999.
Justice Mohd Ghazali said that after going through the notes of
evidence and the judgment, the court found that there were serious errors
by Hashim (currently a Federal Court Judge).
He said the serious misdirection was in the notes of evidence where the
trial judge said at the end of the defence case that the prosecution had
raised a prima facie case against Omar and ordered him to make his defence,
but in his grounds of judgment he said that the defence had failed to raise
any reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case.
This, he said, was a clear misdirection by the judge and was tantamount
to a miscarriage of justice.
Omar filed motions to be freed on grounds of the absence of a written
judgment by the trial judge, while the prosecution cross-appealed against
the acquittal.
Counsel Haresh Mahadevan, for Omar, submitted that the delay of five
years and one month in giving the grounds of judgment was tantamount to a
miscarriage of the justice to Omar.
He said that both parties had written many times to the Seremban High
Court for the grounds of judgment.
Deputy public prosecutor Eddie Yeo submitted that the delay in
providing the grounds of judgment did not occasion a miscarriage of justice
and had not prejudiced Omar.
In his cross-appeal, Yeo said that the trial judge had misdirected
himself in acquitting and discharging Omar when the evidence clearly showed
that it was established beyond reasonable doubt that Omar had caused Abdul
Hamid's death.

"INDONESIAN MAID ON MURDER CHARGE WILL WALK FREE NEXT MONTH
COURT-MURDER
PUTRAJAYA, March 11 (Bernama) -- An Indonesian maid who originally faced a
charge of murdering her employer, and later faced an amended charge of culpable
homicide not amounting to murder, was today delighted to learn she would walk
free next month.
This happened after Herlina Trisnawati, 26, was informed that the amended
charge was substituted by the Federal Court to causing grievious hurt.
Herlina was originally charged with the murder of Soon Lay Chuan, 39, at a
house in Jalan USJ4/2, UEP Subang Jaya, Selangor  about 3pm on Aug 14, 2001.
Three years later, the Shah Alam High Court on Nov 4, convicted and
sentenced her to death after finding her guilty of the offence.
Herlina, of Surabaya, Indonesia then appealed to the Court of Appeal.
On Aug 10, 2005, the court amended the charge from murder to culpable
homicide under Section 304 (a) of the Penal Code which carries a maximum jail
sentence of up to 20 years.
The court sentenced the maid to 18 years' imprisonment from the date of
arrest on Aug 14, 2001.
This morning, the Federal Court substituted the charge from Section 304 (a)
to causing grievious hurt under Section 326 of the Penal Code and sentenced her
to 10 years imprisonment from the date of arrest.
Chief Judge of Sabah and Sarawak, Tan Sri Richard Malanjum in an oral
decision, ruled that Soon's death was not caused by Herlina.
""However, there is sufficient evidence to support the finding that the
accused (Herlina) must have caused the injury on the deceased's neck. In this
case, we are satisfied that the injury on the neck amounted to grievious hurt
under Section 326 of the Penal Code,"" he said.
Presiding with Malanjum were Federal Court judges Datuk Arifin Zakaria and
Datuk Abdul Aziz Mohamad.
Earlier, counsel T. Vijayandran submitted that Herlina did not intend to
kill Soon as they always fought, resulting in the employer getting angry
with the maid.
""This is like a battered maid syndrome,"" he said, urging the court to give
Herlina a lesser punishment.
Vijayandran said that at the time of the offence, Herlina was 19, and she
was working for just three months for Soon.
""She came to Malaysia only for one reason, that is to earn money to support
her family in Indonesia. In fact, she has no previous conviction,"" he added.
Deputy Public Prosecutor Mohamed Hanafiah Zakaria said the grievious
hurt on the deceased's neck showed that Herlina intended to kill Soon.

""After she was informed of Kamaruddin's death, Balqis kept on crying and did
not want to eat anything. She developed a headache and fever,"" she told Bernama

When Kamaruddin was reported missing, Balqis Dayana's thoughts were about

Ramadan breaking-of-fast meal, she said.
Kamaruddin, Sosilawati, the cosmetics queen's lawyer Ahmad Kamil Abdul

Today, police said they had been murdered, their bodies burned and the ashes
thrown into a river near Ladang Gadong in Tanjong Sepat near Banting.
Noorfazilah said Balqis Dayana would be sitting for her UPSR examination on
Sept 22 and 23 and she feared that her daughter's mind was disturbed.
She said she was trying to pacify her by telling her that if she was indeed
the apple of her father's eye, she would recite prayers for her father and would
study hard to be a model daughter as her father would have wanted her to be.
Noorfazilah also has two sons, Izran Akmal, nine, and Irfan Aiman, eight.
""Izran is still confused. When my ex-husband was reported missing, he said
it could not be his father but quietened down after seeing Kamaruddin's
photograph in the newspaper,"" she said.
Irfan Aiman lives with an elder sister of Kamaruddin in Kuantan.
Noorfazilah had married Kamaruddin when he was working with King Studio, a
recording outfit. At that time, she had just started out as a recording artiste,
having produced a ""dangdut"" album.
The couple were close with singers, among them Nash or Nashrudin Elias who

the Nouvelles Visages beauty products.
Noorfazilah said her ex-husband was popularly known as Kamal King to his
older friends and not many of them had known about his disappearance from

in the lift.
Eye-witnesses saw an Indian man, dressed in a black shirt and jeans,
fleeing from the building carrying a package and a helmet.

April 28 and 29 to hear submissions on the trial of a sugar cane juice vendor
who is charged with the murder of an Indonesian housemaid, Muntik Bani, in
October last year.
Judicial Commissioner Mohd Yazid Mustafa fixed the date after counsel V.
Rajehgopal, representing the accused, A.Murugan, applied to the court for time
to complete his written submission.
""The defence counsel had sincerely informed the court that the defence was
ready for the submission but it had not been made in writing and the court took
into consideration that the case took place in 2009 and it had been completed
quickly (at the prosecution's stage) within six months. However, in future,
there is no reason for the defence counsel to seek for further postponement,""
said Mohd Yazid.
Earlier, Deputy Public Prosecutor Idham Abd Ghani applied to the court to
record the prosecution's objection on grounds that both parties had been given
time to prepare their submissions, including the written submission.
""The prosecution had closed its case on March 12 and the court had fixed the

"AZILAH NOT AT ALTANTUYA MURDER SCENE, SAYS LAWYER
COURT-ALTANTUYA
SHAH ALAM, May 13 (Bernama) -- C/Insp Azilah Hadri, the first accused for
the murder of Mongolian Altantuya Shaariibuu, was not at the murder scene but
on duty in Bukit Aman.
His lawyer, J. Kuldeep Kumar, told the High Court this in his preliminary
argument with regard to an entry in the Special Action Unit station diary which
showed Azilah was in his office around 10.18pm and 10.20pm on the night of the
murder.
On the witness stand was investigating officer ASP Tonny Lunggan, the 75th
prosecution witness.
During cross-examination, Kuldeep asked Tonny whether he had seen the
station diary when investigating the case but Deputy Public Prosecutor Tun
Abdul Majid Tun Hamzah objected to the question on the ground that Tonny was
not the person making the entry or keeping the diary.
""I would not have objected if the first accused himself made the entry, but
this entry was made by another person. Thats why it is inadmissible and
hearsay. Unless if it (the evidence) is made through the OCS (officer-in-charge
of the station) or the person who made the entry; not through Tonny,"" he said.
Tun Majid said he understood the defence's intention in mentioning the
station diary which was to establish Azilah's alibi but Tonny was not the
right person to answer the question.
If Kuldeep wanted to have the question answered, he could call the OCS at
the defence stage, he said.
He also raised questions as to whether the entry referred by Kuldeep was
taken from a copy of the same station diary because Tonny had testified that he
was unsure whether its contents were correct unless he had compared it with the
original.
Judge Datuk Mohd Zaki Md Yasin later ordered both parties to submit further
arguments on the issue.
Azilah, 32, and Cpl Sirul Azhar Umar, 37, who are the police's Special
Action Unit operatives are alleged to have murdered Altantuya,28, between 10pm
on Oct 19, 2006 and 1am the following day in Bukit Raja.
Political analyst Abdul Razak Abdullah Baginda, 48, is charged with
abetting them.
The 110th day of trial also saw Tonny telling the court that according to
the Special Action Unit's weapon issuance record book, Azilah had been supplied
with a Glock EAH 387 firearm.
Questioned by Razak's lawyer, Wong Kian Kheong, Tonny said Razak had
mentioned in his cautioned statement that he knew Azilah through DSP Musa Mohd
Safri.
Tonny also said that Altantuya and her cousins -- Uuriintuya Gal-Ochir and
Namiraa Gerelmaa -- had not lodged any police reports over an alleged threat by
Razak or his private investigators P. Balasubramaniam and K. Suras Kumar.
He also did not know whether Razak had met Sirul or there had been
communications between them.
On a mobile phone number belonging to TV3 newscaster Mohd Izwan Azir Mohad
Saleh initially believed to have been used by Razak, Tonny said he had not seen
the document issued by Maxis because it was handed over direct to the court.

COURT-MURDER
SHAH ALAM, April 14  (Bernama) -- A mental patient who was found fit to
stand trial for the murder of a book shop assistant five years ago was today
acquitted and discharged of the offence, without calling for his defence.
Justice Datuk Wira Mohtarudin Baki ordered Chia Yong Tick, 37, to be
released after finding prosecution, represented by deputy public prosecutor
Rosidah Abu Bakar, having failed to establish a prima facie case.
A total of 12 witnesses were called to testify during the trial.
Chia, who has been treated for mental problems since 1994, was charged with
murdering Yong Siew Lee, 28, at the HQ Bookstore, No 7-1, Jalan Bukit Angsana 1,
Taman Bukit Angsana, Cheras, Hulu Langat, about 7pm on Sept 12, 2005.
Yong was found dead with 37 stab wounds on the chest and abdomen. However,
the murder weapon was not found.
In his judgment, Mohtarudin said that on Jan 12 last year, Judicial
Commissioner Abang Iskandar Abang Hashim (who heard the case previously) had
ordered Chia to undergo mental observation, which found him to be suffering from
""bipolar anti-social traits"", but fit to stand trial.
He said the prosecution relied on circumstantial evidence to build the case,
adding that although Chia's DNA was found on his mental patient card and watch
which were found at the scene, they did not lead to an irresistible conclusion.
Mohtarudin said evidence showed that Chia had told his father that he had
robbed a woman , but that the father's testimony was prejudicial, although there
was no objection.
""There was a possibility that Chia's mental patient card was planted there
and there was no evidence to show that a wrist watch found at the scene was his.
""All the evidence are doubtful and not strong enough to establish a prima

discharged,"" he added.

"AIDILFITRI MURDER : TRIO TO KNOW FATE ON JAN 25
COURT-MURDER
KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 15 (Bernama) -- The High Court here today set Jan 25 for a
decision on the case of three family members who are charged with causing the
death of a relative on Aidilfitri, two years ago.
Judicial Commissioner Azman Abdullah set the date after hearing submissions
from the prosecution and defence at the end of the defence's case.
Muhammad Ilyas Abdul Razak, 25, his brother Muhammad Fauzi, 23, and cousin
Muhammad Nizam Mohd Ibrahim, 21, began entering their defence on Dec 30 and
testified from the dock.
Forensic psychiatrist Dr Robiah Mohd Salleh was also called to provide
expert testimony during the defence's case.
The trio were charged with causing the death of Mohd Ibrahim Kader Mydin,
48, and Rosina SM Mydin Pillay, 42, who are the parents of a relative of theirs,
at No 5-7C, Blok A, Flat Seri Sarawak, Jalan Kenanga, here on Oct 1, 2008
between noon and 8pm.
They were originally charged with murder under Section 302 of the Penal Code
where the death sentence is mandatory upon conviction but Azman amended it to
causing death under Section 304 (a) of the same code at the end of the
prosecution's case.
In his submission, counsel Supramaniam Kasia Pillai, who is representing all
three defendants, said there was no direct evidence to show that Muhammad Fauzi
and Muhammad Nizam had conspired to kill the victims and that both of them had
admitted were under a spell at the material time.
Muhammad Ilyas, he said, had serious mental problems which was confirmed by
experts.
""According to witnesses, Muhammad Illyas, who was the mastermind, was
delusional, hallucinating and showed symptoms of mental illness. It is related
to a belief brought about by the Ashaari Abuya group. It was as though Muhamad
Ilyas could communicate with Abuya and could see him when conscious and all his
actions were at the instructions of Abuya. It made them do anything as though on
the instructions of Abuya,"" he said.
Supramaniam urged the court to acquit Muhammad Fauzi and Muhammad Nizam
while Muhammad Ilyas be ordered to undergo treatment at a mental hospital.
However, Deputy Public Prosecutor Aidatul Azura Zainal Abidin disagreed
saying the three had the intention to kill the couple and were conscious of what
they were doing.
He said the motive was to convince other family members that Muhammad Ilyas
had powers to resurrect a person.
He added that their testimonies were bare denials and an empty trick to
sidetrack from the real issue.
""The second and third accused were aware of their actions. Taking the occult
path cannot be used as a defence in this case. This is because the psychatric
expert had testified that the second and third accused were sane and acted to
the wishes of the first accused because of their overwhelming faith in him,"" she
said, adding that Muhammad Ilyas, in truth, also failed to prove that he was
insane because no other experts were called to testify besides Dr Robiah.

"MAN ORDERED TO ENTER DEFENCE IN MURDER OF GIRLFRIEND'S DAUGHTER
COURT-MURDER
KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 15 (Bernama) -- The High Court here ordered a driver who
is also a former bodyguard of a ""Datuk"" to enter defence on a charge of
murdering the daughter of his girlfriend in 2005.
Justice Datuk Ghazali Cha said the prosecution had succeeded in proving a
prima facie case against Davender Singh Sher Singh, of Taman Ibu Kota, Gombak,
here.
Davender Singh, 49, is charged with murdering Nur Farah Adila Ridzuan, aged
two years and 11 months, at No TA-12, Jalan Mewah 3, Taman Ampang, between June
16 and July 1, 2005.
In his judgement, Ghazali said although the defence tried to question the
credibility of the victim's mother, Noriahanim Udin, 38, a hotel worker, the
court found that her evidence could be accepted.
He said that despite the defence team describing Noriahanim as an interested
party in the case, the court could not dismiss all of her evidence.
""It is impossible for Noriahanim to give evidence in details on the
'treatment session' carried out by the accused, who claimed that her former
husband had cast a spell on the child, if she was not there to witness the
incident,"" he said.
Furthermore, he said, the witness' evidence on the injuries suffered by the
victim in the ""treatment session"" was consistent with the medical report.
""Although there are some contradictions to Noriahanim's testimony, the
contradiction is not profound that the testimony should be rejected,"" Ghazali
said.
He said that based on the medical report, some of the victims left and right
ribs were broken, the pancreas having pus while almost all of her organs were
not functioning due to injuries believed to have been inflicted by beatings with
blunt objects.
Ghazali said the court also took into account the testimonies of other
witnesses who had seen the child in weak condition prior to her death and that
the victim was often seen leaving the house late at night with the accused.
Davender's lawyer, K. Balaguru told the court he would call in two
witnesses.

K. Sarawanan, 19, and U. Suresh, 26, each charged with seven counts of
disposing of evidence, were charged under Section 201 of the Penal Code.
Magistrate Hurman Hussain sentenced them to seven years' jail on each count
to be served concurrently from the date of their arrest on Sept 9 this year.
They were among eight arrested by police between Sept 9 and 12 in connection
with the disappearance of Sosilawati and three others on Aug 30.

by Saiful Edris Zainuddin and Idham Abdul Ghani, appeared for the prosecution.
In mitigation, Puravelan told the court to take into account the social
skill and background of his clients when setting the judgment.
When handing down the sentence, Hurman said he took into account the action
by the accused in disposing of evidence in a murder case, the implication of
their action to the families of the deceased and the society, as well as the
background of the accused.
After Hurman handed down the sentence, Sarawanan and Suresh told the court
that they felt remorse and apologised to society for their action.
They spoke in Tamil and was translated into Malay by the court interpreter.
According to the facts produced by the prosecution, Sarawanan had seen
Noorhisham, Ahmad Kamil, Kamaruddin and Sosilawati murdered by Thilaiyalagan at

Sarawanan was then ordered by Thilaiyalagan and Matan to bring some petrol
and diesel which were stored at the home of one of the estate workers.
He then brought two white containers with the fuels and handed them to
Thilaiyalagan and Matan.
Thilaiyalagan and Matan together with Sarawanan then laid the bodies on
piles of wood that had been arranged earlier, followed by additional wood placed
on the corpses.
Thilaiyalagan and Matan then poured petrol and diesel on the bodies before
setting them on fire.
Meanwhile, Suresh, who was at the farm at 8am the next day, saw
Thilaiyalagan and Matan carrying something at the crime scene located besides a
hut and putting it in a blue barrel.
When he asked the duo what was inside the barrel, they had told him it was
the ashes of Ahmad Kamil, Kamaruddin, Noorhisham and Sosilawati whom they had
killed and burnt the previous day.
Suresh together with Kathavarayan and Thilaiyalagan then went to Sungai
Panchau in a Isuzu D-Max vehicle to scatter the ashes into the river and also
dispose the barrel in it, which they completed doing at 10am before returning to
the farm.
Suresh and Thilaiyalagan were then ordered by Khatavarayan to clean up the
crime scene and get rid of any debris and also the zinc sheets that had been
used as the base to incinerate the bodies.
The three of them then loaded all these in a lorry before disposing the
debris at a rubbish dump in Sungai Arak, Kampung Kelanang, Banting, while the

COURT-MUNTIK
SHAH ALAM, July 19 (Bernama) -- A night market trader was sentenced to death
by the High Court here today for the murder of Indonesian maid, Muntik Bani,
last October.
Justice Mohd Yazid Mustafa made the decision after finding that the defence
had failed to raise reasonable doubts on the prosecution's case against A.
Murugan, 36.
In his judgment, Mohd Yazid said Murugan's defence was merely based on
denial.
He said the court agreed with the prosecution's submission that Murugan's
testimony was not reasonably true or consistent with his innocence.
He said the court was also satisfied that the injuries sustained by the
maid was caused by Murugan.
""In this case, the court also accepted circumstantial evidence, direct
evidence, like the evidence by a police witness who found the victim in the
toilet and the confession by the accused's wife that it was the accused who
locked the victim in the toilet and the dying declaration by the victim (that
the accused had inflicted the injuries on her).
""The court is satisfied there is overwhelming evidence which led to the
injuries caused by the accused to cause her death.
""Therefore, the court is satisfied that the prosecution has succeeded in
establishing the case beyond reasonable doubt and in this case, there is only
one sentence, which is to sentence the accused to death by hanging,"" he added.
Murugan, who was in the dock, did not show any reaction when the court
handed down the sentence.
He was charged with murdering Muntik, 40, at house No 11, Jalan Datuk

BANTING, Sept 16 (Bernama) -- The main suspect in the murder of cosmetics
queen Datuk Sosilawati Lawiya is believed to be involved in a number of missing
person, murder and commercial crime cases in the Kuala Langat district, Selangor
police chief Datuk Khalid Abu Bakar said today.
He said the suspect, a lawyer, was being investigated into the disappearance
of a male Indian national since early this year.
However, he added, a police report on the missing businessman was only
lodged on Sept 8.
""So, how could we have known (about this case) if there was no police report
made?"" he said at a press conference after a police-community function at the
Kuala Langat district police headquarters which was also attended by
Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Ismail Omar and his deputy Datuk Hussin
Ismail, here.
Khalid said the lawyer was also linked to the murder of a woman in Banting
last year.
A newspaper report today said the 44-year-old woman, T.Selvi, who was the
wife of an auto workshop owner, was believed to have been killed over a loan
dispute involving the lawyer.
""Although the woman's husband has made various statements on the case, I
don't wish to comment on it as the case is still under investigation,"" said
Khalid.
He said police had received new leads on this murder case following the
investigation into the murder of Sosilawati, her driver Kamarudin Shansuddin,
44, lawyer Ahmad Kamil Abdul Karim, 32, and bank officer Noorhisham Mohamad, 38.
""This case (Selvi's murder) was never closed and we will investigate to
obtain more information.""
Khalid said police had received seven commercial crime reports against the
lawyer including on criminal breach of trust and cheating in land transactions
since 2005, involving losses amounting to RM7.1 million for the victims.
He said these cases would be investigated by the police Commercial Crime
Department and that investigations into such cases would take some time as the
police needed to examine various documents.
Asked whether the police in Kuala Langat had been ""bought over"" by the
lawyer, Khalid said anyone with information on this should report directly to

SOSILAWATI-IGP
BANTING, Sept 16 (Bernama) -- Inspector-General of Police (IGP) Tan Sri
Ismail Omar said the investigation into the murder of cosmetics queen Sosilawati
Lawiya and three others was not racially motivated.
""This case is like any other criminal case as there are the criminals and
the victims,"" he said at a dialogue with local community leaders at the Kuala
Langat district police headquarters, here, today in conjunction with his visit
to Selangor as the new IGP.
Ismail also said that investigations into cases which had racial elements
like the arson on churches in Selangor and surau in Johor were carried out based
on the law.
However, he said, the public should understand that the process of
prosecution came under the jurisdiction of the Attorney-General and not the
police.
Ismail said this after one of the community leaders present questioned why
cases involving the throwing of paint and liquor bottles at surau were not
brought to court unlike cases involving the torching of churches.
On another note, the IGP said he had ordered Selangor police including in
the Kuala Langat district to monitor the rising involvement of the local youths
in crime.
He said he would also look into the need to increase manpower and logistical
support for the district police headquarters and to place an Assistant
Commissioner of Police to head the police there instead of a Superintendent like
now.
The matter was raised by Kuala Langat MCA division chief Datuk Eii Kim
Hock who said the dictrict police needed to be beefed up due to rapid
development in Kuala Langat, which is surrounded by such areas as Putrajaya and
the Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Sepang, besides having a long
coastline.
Eii said the Kuala Langat district now had a population of about 200,000 and
hoped that more police cars would patrol the area so that the people there would
feel safer with increased police presence.
While he thanked police for taking action against illegal gambling
activities in the district, Eii also praised their swift investigation into the
murder of Sosilawati and three others although the Raya celebration was on.

district by 14 per cent between January and August this year.

CHENNAI, Nov 16 (Bernama) -- Three Indian nationals, who were part of 20
people
quizzed in connection with the murder of a Malaysian woman and her two children
last week, are believed to have slipped into Malaysia.
Tamil Nadu police believe the trio, in their 30s, and from here, had left
for
Kuala Lumpur on Nov 12, via a Jet Airways flight.
One of them is believed to be in possession of a Malaysian identity card and
had stayed in Malaysia previously.
The fugitives are wanted in connection with the murder of housewife M.
Adhila
Banu, 24, and her children, Ajira Banu, five, and Mohd Aslam, seven.
The victims were strangled and their bodies dumped in a swollen canal in
Vadipatti, Madurai, about 160km from their house, on Nov 8.
""We suspect these (killings) are the work of hired killers and have seized a
Scorpio (four-wheel drive vehicle) which we suspect was used in the events
leading to the murders,"" Vadipatti police inspector P. R. Lakshmanan told
Bernama today.
On Nov 8, Adhila Banu, accompanied by the children, had gone to a nearby
sundry shop in her village, Barathi Nagar, to purchase cooking gas when they
were believed to have been kidnapped.
Three days later, the police discovered their decomposed bodies.
According to police investigations, a gang had earlier demanded 250,000
Indian rupees (about RM17,000) from the victim's family which refused to pay the
money.
Now, the police are piecing sketchy clues which had given a new twist to the
murders.
According to investigators, Adhila was ostracised by the village 'panchayat'
(committee) for several years after she had married a man of a different
religion.
Thus, the money (250,000 Indian rupees) was ostensibly to settle the dispute
so that she could return to her native village with her children.
Adhila had been staying in Malaysia with her husband, an Indian national
with Malaysian permanent resident status, and returned to her native village
about a month ago to visit her mother.
Her husband, Muthusamy alias Mohammad, was last heard working in Malaysia as
a driver.

known on April 9.
Shah Alam High Court judge Datuk Mohd Zaki Md Yasin set the date after hearing
submissions from all the parties at the end of the defence's case yesterday and
today.
C/Insp Azilah Hadri, 33, and Cpl Sirul Azhar Umar, 37, were called to enter
their defence last Oct 31. Azilah testified in his defence from the witness
stand while Sirul Azhar read out his written testimony from the dock.
No other defence witnesses were called.
Azilah and Sirul Azhar are charged with murdering Altantuya Shaariibuu, 28,
between Lot 12843 and Lot 16735 Mukim Bukit Raja near here between 10pm on Oct
19 adn 1 am on Oct 20, 2006.
Before this, they were tried together with Malaysian Strategic Research Centre
executive director, Abdul Razak Abdullah Baginda, 48, who was charged with
abetment.
However, on Oct 31, 2008, the poltical analyst was acquitted and discharged
without his defence being called after the prosecution failed to make out a
prima facie case against him.
In his submission, Deputy Public Prosecutor Manoj Kurup had submitted that
Azilah could not prove his alibi that he was not at the murder scence on the
night in question.
He said Azilah also did not call a single witness to corroborate his alibi.
""All we have is the ipse dixit of the first accused that he was at Wangsa
Maju (in Kuala Lumpur). The notice of alibi mandated under Section 402A of the
Criminal Procedure Code mentions persons acquainted with the fact of alibi. Yet,
for reasons best known to the first accused, he chose not to call as witnesses
the persons named in P430 (Azilah's girlfriend, Nur Azila Baharuddin).
""Now, my lord, it is trite that an adverse inference should not be drawn
against an accused person for failure to call a particular witness or adduce
evidence which he could have. Failure to call any witness or adduce evidence
should not be made the subject of an adverse comment, and it must be emphasized
that the prosecution is not doing that.
""What we are submitting is simply this, by failing to call his alibi
witness, the first accused lost the chance of casting a reasonable doubt on the
prosecution's case,"" he said.
Manoj also submitted that the testimony on oath of Azilah's is littered with
inconsistencies, discrepancies and improbabilities, so much so, that only one
inference is possible from it, the 1st accused is spinning a yarn.
""The first accused said he did not ask Abdul Razak Abdullah why the Chinese
woman and the Chinese man were extorting him ('ugut'). He also said DSP Musa
Safri did not give him details about the problems faced by Abdul Razak Abdullah.
""So why did the first accused not ask Abdul Razak Abdullah what the 'ugut' was
about? Wouldn't any reasonable police officer want to know? It is respectfully
submitted that the evidence of the 1st accused here is inherently incredible,""
he said.
Manoj said Azilah's evidence was not in the least surprising for the following
two reasons. Firstly, he said: ""The first accused admitted under
cross-examination that he had full discretion as to what action to take with
respect to the problem faced by Abdul Razak and that Abdul Razak left everything
to him to solve his problem.
""Secondly, the first accused admitted, also under cross-examination, that as
far as he was concerned, 'masalah Abdul Razak telah selesai pada malam itu juga'
(Abdul Razak's problem had been settled that night itself). Then he quickly
denied that he knew what had happened to the deceased. How could he know Abdul
Razak's problem was already solved that very night without knowing what had
happened to the deceased? The first accused got trapped in his own sticky web of
lies here.""
Manoj also submitted that both accused persons now competed against each other
for the prize of best fiction told in Court and that both versions ought to be
rejected as not being able to cast a reasonable doubt as to their complicity and
guilt in the murder of Altantuya.
""One critical matter for scrutiny arises here. If indeed it was the case
that it was the second accused who was supposed to take the deceased back to the
hotel, why continue the journey to Bukit Aman and do the transfer of the
deceased there? Why not do it at the place where they had stopped?.
""The first accused said the second accused wanted to proceed on to Bukit
Aman first but no explanation was given for this. The first accused was the
superior officer of the second accused, but he appeared to have blindly followed
the second accused to Bukit Aman, with no reasons being forwarded for this
quaint behaviour. The defence of the two accused persons begs questions but
answers none,"" Manoj said.
At the end of his submission, Manoj said the several strands of
circumstantial evidence that the prosecution had painstakingly proved had
remained unrebutted, unexplained and unanswered by both accused persons in this
case.
""The combined strength of those strands of evidence when twisted together
has formed two ropes, strong enough to hang each accused person.    It is
respectfully submitted that no reasonable doubt is cast on the prosecution's
case by either accused. The prosecution has proven beyond reasonable doubt the
guilt of the two accused, warranting a conviction on the charge of murder
committed in pursuance to a common intention of them both,"" he said.

BANGKOK, April 17 (Bernaa) -- Media tycoon Sondhi Limthongkul, who led
street protests that led to the ouster of three Thai prime ministers in le ss
than three years, was injured in an assasination attempt early Friday.
A Thai police spokesman said Sondhi was injured on his arm but his driver
was in critical condition.
The incident happened about 5am when Sondhi's car was ambushed by unknown
men in a pick-up.
The attempted murder came days after rioting in the capital where thousands
of red-shirted supporters of ousted premier Thaksin Shinawatra battled soldiers
in a bid to force Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva to resign.
Sondhi, who runs the ASTV cable television and the Manager newspaper, led
massive rallies in the capital in 2006 which led to the military ouster of
Thaksin in September the same year.
When Thaksin's allies won the military-organised election in2007, Sondhi led
the People's Allliance for Democracy (PAD) to the streets again.
In the six-month long street protests by the yellow-shirted, the PAD
besieged the Government House, closed down Bangkok's two major airports and saw
the departure of prime ministers Samak Sundaravej and Somchai Wongsawat.
Abhisit and his Democrat party gained from the crisis, winning enough
support in Parliamment last December to become the kingdom's 27th prime minister
but is widely seen as an illegitimate leader by Thaksin allies.
It had been a turbulent week for Thailand and Abhisit, as Thaksin's
supporters forced the cancellation of the Asean+6 Summit in Pattaya and caused
rioting in Bangkok where two people were killed and 123 injured.
The state of emergency declared by Abhisit last Sunday remained in force as
the authorities continued to arrest key leaders of the red-shirt group and
cancelled the passport of Thaksin who is currently living in exile.

Deputy Public Prosecutors Salehuddin Saidin who is head of the Classified
Cases Unit, and Noorin Badaruddin who heads the General Crimes and Sexual
Unit.
The prosecution will now be led by DPPs Tun Abdul Majid Tun Hamzah,
Wong Chiang Kiat and Manoj Kurup.
Tun Abdul Majid heads the Legal Unit and Wong the Appeals Unit where
Manoj also serves.
The case which has attracted local and foreign media interest has been
scheduled to go until August and then resumes until all the witnesses have
been called.
There are 132 names on the witness list including police, private
investigators and Altantuya's family members including her father, Dr
Shaariibuu Setev.
On June 6, Attorney-General Tan Sri Abdul Gani Patail explained that he
had to replace the prosecution team in the interest of justice as
Salehuddin had been seen playing badminton with Justice Mohd Zaki.
Abdul Gani said in view of the sensitivity of the case, he decided to
exclude Salehuddin from the trial to ensure that there would be no untoward
allegation or adverse public perception of his officers and the court.
Two members of the police Special Action Squad, Chief Inspector Azilah
Hadri, 30, and Corporal Sirul Azhar Umar, 35, are on trial for the murder
of Altantuya, 28, and well-known political analyst Abdul Razak Abdullah
Baginda, 46, for abetment.
Azilah and Sirul Azhar are charged with committing the murder at Mukim
Bukit Raja, Selangor, between 10pm on Oct 19 and 1am on Oct 20, last year.
Abdul Razak is charged with abetting the policemen at his office, Level
10, Bangunan Getah Asli, Jalan Ampang, here between 9.45am and 11.05 on Oct
18, last year.
Altantuya was shot dead and her body blown up with explosives.
Fragments of her remains were found in Puncak Alam, Shah Alam on last Nov
7.
The three accused face the death sentence if convicted.
Just like on June 4, the courtroom is expected to be packed tomorrow
with members of the media and public.
Attention will also be focused on veteran lawyer Karpal Singh who will
be asking the court to hear his application for the right to question
prosecution witnesses and make submissions while he holds a watching brief
for Altantuya's family.
Some observers feel the case could also be postponed again to hear
Karpal Singh's other application for lawyer Hazman Ahmad be disqualified
from representing Azilah, following no decision made by the Appeals Court
on the application.
Justice Mohd Zaki, had on June 4, dismissed the application, saying
that the fact that his late niece was married to Hazman was insufficient
grounds for him to order the lawyer to disqualify himself.
Abdul Razak is represented by lawyer Wong Kian Kheong, Azilah by Hazman
and J. Kuldeep, and Sirul Azhar by Kamarul Hisham Kamarudin, Hasnal Rezua
Merican Habib Marican and Ahmad Zaidi Zainal.

"MURUGIAH LODGES POLICE REPORT OVER SMS LINKING HIM TO SOSILAWATI MURDER SUSPECT
MURUGIAH-SMS
KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 17 (Bernama) -- Deputy Minister in the Prime Minister's
Department Datuk T. Murugiah today lodged a police report in Ipoh over an SMS
message linking him to the main suspect in the murder of cosmetics queen Datuk
Sosilawati Lawiya.
He said in a statement that the report was made at the New Town police
station after receiving the SMS which he claimed was a lie and libellous.
""The SMS is a libellous statement against me, purposely linking me to the
main suspect in the brutal murder of Sosilawati, and it is not true at all,"" he
said.
He said the statement read as follows: ""Peguam yang kena charge dalam kes
Sosilawati bercadang sertai MIC kata Murugiah yang merupakan kawan baik beliau.
Peguam ini juga adalah salah seorang penasihat Timbalan Menteri tersebut dalam
kes ROS. Murugiah adalah rakan kongsi peguam dalam perniagaan di mana Murugiah
dapat 3 juta dalam satu deal.""
(The lawyer suspect in the Sosilawati case plans to join the MIC, said
Murugiah, who is a good friend of his. This lawyer is also an advisor of the
deputy minister in his case with ROS (Registrar of Societies). Murugiah is a
partner of the lawyer in a business where Murugiah received 3 million in one
deal.)
Murugiah said the suspect was not the lawyer who handled his case with the
ROS and that the SMS was intentionally sent to undermine his image and position
in politics and as a deputy minister.
""I believe the SMS was sent by those who have vested political interests and
would benefit should my political career be ruined.
""This is a most serious matter. It is not only a libellous SMS but its
dissemination can undermine the investigation into the high-profile Sosilawati
murder case,"" he said.
Murugiah, when calling on Sosilawati's family following her murder, had said
that he had met the lawyer suspect at the presentation of Aidilfitri donations
in Banting on Sept 8 and that the lawyer had expressed to him an interest to
join the MIC.
Sosilawati, 47, her driver Kamaruddin Shamsuddin, 44, lawyer Ahmad Kamil
Abdul Karim, 32, and CIMB Bank officer Noorhisham Mohammad, 38, went missing on
Aug 30 after they went to Banting in Selangor over a land deal.
Police found out that the four were killed, their bodies burnt and the ashes
thrown into rivers near Ladang Gadong, Tanjung Sepat, near Banting.
Eight suspects, among them two lawyers, have been detained to facilitate
investigations into the murders.
Meanwhile, Ipoh police acting chief Supt Ibrahim Abu Bakar, when contacted,
confirmed that a police report on the SMS was lodged by Murugiah's secretary at
the New Town police station at 10am today.
""The deputy minister had received the SMS while attending a programme in

He also said that the secretary lodged a police report at the Teluk Intan

A home-made gun, known as 'bakakuk' and believed to be the murder weapon, was
seized from the suspect.
The police believe the man could facilitate investigations into the killing of
Saipon Kayapo, 46, who was one of 40 smallholders who were attacked by about 20
workers at the plantation.
In the incident on Feb 12, Saipon was slashed on the head and shot in the back.
He died on the spot.
Two other smallholders were seriously injured, one with slash wounds on the
forehead and the other with a gunshot wound in the right leg.
The suspect's arrest brings to seven, the number of people arrested so far, in
connection with the murder.
Speaking to reporters at the state police headquarters today, Sabah Police
Commissioner Datuk Noor Rashid Ibrahim said the ex-convict was the main suspect
in the killing.
He said the man was expected to be charged for murder soon.
Lawyer Ansari Abdullah, who is representing the deceased's family and
families of those injured in the incident, claimed the smallholders had lodged
many police reports, asking for police escort to the plantation.
However, he said, the police did not heed to their requests.

by the High Court here today, without his defence being called, on a charge of
murdering a secretary, four years ago.
Mokhtar Mohd Zin, 47, was freed of killing Siti Shamiza Ab Karim at a car park
of the Giant hypermarket in Batu Caves.
In ordering his release, Judge Datuk Zaharah Ibrahim said the prosecution had
failed to make out a prima facie case against the accused.
In her judgement, she said several doubts had been raised during the trial,
such as the accused's identification, link between a car and bullet, and the
absence of a pistol believed to have been used in the murder.
""The court found that five witnesses had seen the accused, only in passing.
Three of the witnesses did not see the accused in a calm state of mind while
another looked at him sideways when the car (a witness' car) was knocked into.
""One more witness saw him from the back, another when the pistol was pointed
at (by the accused). After going through the testimonies, it is unsafe for me to
accept the identification (of the accused) made by the four witnesses.
""Another witness (the fifth witness) claimed to have seen a picture of the
accused on television. I am afraid that the identification parade was only done,
10 days after the picture appeared in the media,"" she noted.
She said doubts were also raised on the bullet fired at the victim and the
bullet found in a car, but no explanation was given about them and their link.
""There were also doubts on how the bullet could be linked to a pistol that
was never recovered. Therefore, the prosecution had failed to prove a prima
facie case and the accused is released and acquitted without his defence being
called,"" she added.
Earlier, Zaharah said the investigating officer had claimed that a mobile
phone recovered beside the victim, belonged to the accused based on information
received but it (the mobile phone) was not produced in court and no witnesses
attested it belonged to the accused.
Mokhtar was charged with the murder of Siti Shamiza, a secretary at Bumi
Hiway (M) Sdn Bhd, during a robbery at a car park of the Giant hypermarket in
Batu Caves at 1.45pm on March 19, 2005.
Mokhtar, who appeared composed when the decision was announced, told

His family members who were present in court, were overcome with joy.
However, Mokhtar was led out of the court room in handcuffs as he is facing

PUTRAJAYA, July 20 (Bernama) -- The conviction and death sentence on two
friends for the murder of Singaporean actress Una Angelia Oliveiro was upheld by
the Court of Appeal here today.
Justices Datuk Hasan Lah, Datuk Ahmad Maarop and Datuk Sulaiman Daud ruled
there was no reason for the appellate court to disturb the findings of the
Kuala Lumpur High Court because the trial judge had carefully evaluated the
evidence of the prosecution witnesses.
The three-man quorum dismissed the appeals brought by unemployed Mohd Fazli
Ismail, 28, and make-up artist Esma Faizul Zainul Nor, 39, to set their
conviction and death sentence by a High Court on Oct 6, last year.
The duo were found guilty of killing the 44-year old Singaporean mother of
three at her bungalow in Jalan Bukit Travers in Brickfields, Kuala Lumpur at
11.15am on Nov 14, 2001.
Oliveiro, of Chinese and English parentage, who played the role of 'Opah' in
local sitcom 'Kipas Anggun', was found dead in the dining room with six stab
wounds on her chest.
Hasan noted Esma Faizul's confession to his girlfriend, Siti Sarah Ismail,
who is Mohd Fazli's sister, and a friend, Zaimy Roduan, admitting that he had
killed the actress.
Counsel for the two men argued that their convictions were not safe due to
the presence of unknown DNA found on the dismantled gate at the deceased's house
and fingernails of the deceased, indicating the presence of a third person at
the scene of crime.
Sreekant Pillai, representing Mohd Fazli, submitted that it was the duty of
the prosecution to eliminate the existence of other persons at the crime scene
and the evidence must point to the appellants that they were the ones who
committed the murder.
Amer Hamzah Arshad for Esma Faizul said the trial judge erred in completeely

"ACCUSED IN CANNY ONG'S MURDER WANTS EXHIBITS PRODUCED IN FINAL APPEAL
COURT-CANNY
PUTRAJAYA, May 21 (Bernama) -- In his final appeal at the Federal Court to
escape the death row for the murder of killing IT analyst Canny Ong Lay Kian,
Ahmad Najib Aris wants two crucial exhibits to be produced.
The first exhibit comprises coloured photographs of a closed-circuit television
(CCTV) camera image allegedly showing Ahmad Najib and Canny in her car, speeding
out of the Bangsar Shopping Centre car park where she was abducted.
In disputing the identity of the man in the car with Canny, Ahmad Najib's
lawyer, Mohamed Haniff Khatri Abdulla (rpt Abdulla) said the photographs were
necessary to be produced in court to determine the identity.
The defence also wanted a concrete-filled tyre, which was placed on top of
Canny's charred body in the man-hole, to be produced in court to show the
impossibility of the accused person to lift the tyre from the side of the road,
over a shoulder-height wall into the manhole.
Haniff then applied for a postponement of the hearing of the appeal before the
court's five-man bench, due to the unavailability of the exhibits.
Chief Judge of Sabah and Sarawak Tan Sri Richard Malanjum who led the
quorum, adjourned the appeal to a date to be fixed.
The other members of the bench were Federal Court judges Datuk Nik Hashim
Nik Ab Rahman, Datuk S. Augustine Paul, Datuk Hashim Yusoff and Datuk Zulkefli
Ahmad Makinudin.
Ahmad Najib, 32, is appealing against the Court of Appeal's dismissal of
his appeal to set aside his conviction, death sentence and 20-year jail term
meted out by the Shah Alam High Court for the murder and rape of the
28-year-old victim.
The former aircraft cabin cleaning supervisor was found guilty and sentenced to
death by the Shah Alam High Court on Feb 23, 2005 for committing the offence at
Batu 7, Jalan Klang Lama, between 1am and 5am on June 14, 2003.
He was also sentenced to 20 years' jail and ordered to be whipped 10 times for
raping the woman at the same place, time and date.
Ong's charred body was found in a sewage hole, four days after she was
abducted from the car park at the Bangsar Shopping Centre.
In today's proceeding, Malanjum was hesitant to adjourn the appeal
proceedings but relented in the interest of justice.
""We want to make things move. Due to the interest of justice, we have no
choice but to postpone the case,"" said Malanjum who was unahappy with the
delay to obtain the exhibits.
Haniff said unfortunately, the two exhibits were unavailable today although
he had written two letters to the Federal Court registrar requesting for the
production of the exhibits. The registrar subsequently, wrote to the Shah Alam
High Court on the request.
He, however, conceded that he did not conduct a follow-up on that
matter.
Zulkefli then asked whose duty it was to ensure that exhibits in a criminal
case be produced before the appellate court, on hearing the appeal.
Deputy Public Prosecutor Datuk Nordin Hassan said it was the practice that
the exhibits were not brought to the court, unless requested.
Nik Hashim, however, disagreed, citing a case where a parang and cangkul were
brought to the court on appeal.

BANTING, Sept 21 (Bernama) -- The lawyer who is a suspect in the murders of
cosmetics queen Datuk Sosilawati Lawiya and three others was today taken to his
law firm here for a second time since his arrest over a week ago.
The 41-year-old man, wearing the purple lock-up attire, was taken to the
premises by a team of policemen at 2.25pm.
About 35 minutes later, two women, believed to be staff at the law firm,
were seen coming out of the office, holding several documents.
The suspect was taken out of the office at 3.05pm and was whisked away in a
Proton Waja police car.
A policeman was also seen coming out of the office, holding several files.
The man was later taken to a sluice at Kampung Sungai Lang here, about 3km
from the his office, where Marine Operations Force members were scouring the
river for new leads.
Sosilawati, 47, her driver Kamaruddin Shamsuddin, 44, lawyer Ahmad Kamil
Abdul Karim, 32, and CIMB Bank officer Noorhisham Mohammad, 38, went missing on
Aug 30 after they went to Banting in Selangor over a land deal.
Police found out that the four were killed, their bodies burnt and the ashes
thrown into rivers near Ladang Gadong, Tanjung Sepat, near here.
Police arrested the man and seven others, including the man's younger
brother, also a lawyer, in connection with the case.
On Sept 14, police searched the law firm and took documents and computers.
Previous reports indicated that the law firm was the last location the four
victims were seen alive.
Meanwhile, the Bar Council said the certificates in legal practice for the
two lawyers had been suspended and that the two were disbarred on Nov 5 last
year.
Bar Council president Ragunath Kesavan told a news conference in Kuala

misconduct.
The two had filed an appeal to the High Court here for a stay of the
suspension order.
""Following the stay, they continued practising law but their memberships
with the Bar Council have been cancelled,"" he said, adding that lawyers found to
have misappropriated their clients' account, involved in corruption and other
serious offences would have their licences cancelled.

"BURGER SELLER ORDERED TO MAKE DEFENCE ON MURDER CHARGE
COURT-MURDER
PUTRAJAYA, Jan 22 (Bernama) -- The Federal Court here has ordered that the
trial records from a previous criminal case of a burger seller, revealing his
modus operandi, be admitted as evidence in the present murder trial.
Chief Judge of Malaya Tan Sri Arifin Zakaria, Chief Judge of Sabah and
Sarawak Tan Sri Richard Malanjum and Federal Court judge Datuk James Foong Cheng
said it was their finding that the modus operandi of Mohamad Roslan Desa in the
previous case and the present case was very similar.
The court said the evidence of Roslan's earlier offence of causing death to
a woman must be treated as fully cogent as whatever prejudice the previous case
might have on Roslan, it was far outweighed by the probative value of the
evidence sought to be admitted.
It held that the prosecution had clearly made out a prima facie case against
Roslan.
""Therefore, had the trial judge and the Court of Appeal admitted the similar
facts as evidence and evaluated the circumstantial evidence in the way that it
should have been done instead of giving it merely cusory treatment, their
decision might have been otherwise,"" Arifin said in his 21-page judgment
delivered on Jan 18.
Consequently, the quorum allowed the prosecution's appeal to remit Roslan's
case back to the High Court for him to make his defence on the charge of
murdering Ooi Yean Wah, 24.
He was alleged to have mudered Ooi in Jalan Solok Sembilan, Seberang Jaya,
Butterworth, and disposed of her body in a drain in Kampung Padang Buluh, Tikam
Batu, Kuala Muda, Kedah in 1998.
The prosecution brought the matter to the Federal Court after the High Court
acquitted Roslan of the murder charge without calling for his defence and the
decision was subsequently affirmed by the Court of Appeal.
The High court, in acquitting the 35-year-old burger seller, refused the
prosecution's application to tender the similar facts from Roslan's previous
case as it held that they did not show striking similarity between what happened
in the earlier case and the present case.
The Court of Appeal affirmed that finding.
Similar facts comprising trial records, charge sheet and notes of evidence
of his previous court case disclosed that Roslan would deflate the tyre of his
victim's car and then follow her.
On the pretext of rendering assistance, Roslan would approach the victim and
after having gotten the trust of the victim, he would get into the victim's car
and stab the victim with a knife.
Roslan would then drop off the victim at some place and drive off with
her car before abandoning the vehicle. He would also take jewellery and other
belongings of the victim.
In the previous case, Roslan was jailed six years after he pleaded guilty at
the Butterworth Sessions Court to a charge under Section 304 of the Penal Code

"STOREKEEPER SENT TO GALLOWS FOR MURDER
COURT-MURDER
SHAH ALAM, March 22 (Bernama) -- A jilted storekeeper who strangled the woman
he loved because she was set to marry another, was sentenced to death by the
High Court here today.
Shahrul Nizam Mohd Shah, 38, was found guilty of strangling Nurul Hazira Bharum
in Rawang on Oct 7, 2008.
The offence was committed at Lot 2584-1, Batu 19, Kampung Gombak in Kuang about
9am.
Earlier in his defence, Shahrul told the court that he and Nurul Hazira, 26,
had planned to commit suicide by drinking poison ""like Romeo and Juliet"".
In his defence, Shahrul Nizam claimed that he and Nurul Hazira were planning
to commit suicide, and that the victim had forced him to drink poison.
However, a post-mortem report revealed that Nurul Hazira died of suffocation
due to strangulation and that no poison was found in her body.
In passing sentence, Judge Datuk Wira Mohtarudin Baki said the strong
pressure put by the accused to strangle the victim was consistent with the
broken necklace found in the victim's shirt.
""The accused claimed that he had taken a few sips of the poison and passed
out. He claimed that the victim had pulled his hand and put it on her chest and
that when he regained consciousness, his hand was already on the victim's chest.
""No statement indicated that the victim was planning to commit suicide. Not
even from her parents, colleagues and fiance,"" he said, adding that the position
of her body was inconsistent with the ""drinking poison"" story.
Apart from that, Mohtarudin said, the statement made by the seventh
prosecution witness (a neighbour) that Shahrul Nizam had sought his help and
said that the victim had drunk poison, was not consistent with his (Shahrul
Nizam's) claim that both of them had planned to commit suicide together.
""All of these are not consistent and his (Shahrul Nizam's) defence was
merely an afterthought and failed to raise any doubts.
""Therefore, I find the accused guilty and sentence him to death by hanging,""
added the judge.
Throughout the trial, the prosecution called 15 witnesses while the defence,
one.

prosecution while Shahrul Nizam was represented by Azizzul Shariman Mat Yusoff.

"GALLOWS FOR PRISONS OFFICER FOR PRISONER'S MURDER
COURT-MURDER
PUTRAJAYA, March 22 (Bernama) -- A prisons officer was today given a date with
the hangman when the Federal Court here upheld his conviction and death sentence
over the murder of a teenage prisoner, about six years ago.
Chief Judge of Malaya Tan Sri Arifin Zakaria and Federal Court judges Datuk
Wira Mohd Ghazali Mohd Yusoff and Datuk Seri Md Raus Sharif unanimously
dismissed Azhar Che Will's final appeal to quash the sentence and conviction.
Md Raus said the fatal injury that caused Mohd Shukri Mohd Yusof's death was
inflicted by Azhar, the former Penor prison security unit head.
He said that assaults by the other prison warders at three other places could
not have caused Mohd Shukri's death.
Azhar, 37, and six other prison warders were jointly charged with the murder of
the 19-year-old at the Penor prison, Kuantan between 4pm and 7pm on March
1, 2004.
The Kuantan High Court convicted Azhar but freed five warders -- Teyun Thian
Eim, Suhaimi Nordin, Mohamad Hamdan Mohd Yaakob, Ahmad Rizal Abdul Halim and
Ismail @ Mat Daud Deris -- without calling for their defence.
The same high court had also freed warder Shamsul Darniza Ismail before
commencement of submission at the close of the prosecution's case when the
prosecution conceded no prima facie case had been made out against him.
Azhar brought the matter up to the Federal Court for appeal after he was
unsuccessful at the Court of Appeal which had on May 5, last year, affirmed his
death sentence and conviction.
Meanwhile, the acquittal of the five warders was also upheld by the Court of
Appeal and Federal Court, respectively.
Md Raus, in his 19-page judgment, said the court was satisfied that Azhar
was not prejudiced when the High Court did not amend the charge against him
(Azhar) to delete any reference in the charge to the co-accused.
He said the non-deletion of reference to the co-accused did not render the
charge bad in law, adding that the fact that the other co-accused were
acquitted, did not have any bearing on the case against Azhar.
Evidence adduced at the trial in the High Court was that in 2004, Mohd
Shukri, a remand prisoner at Penor Prison, attempted to escape but was
apprehended and assaulted by a few prison personnel in three areas of the
prison.
Mohd Shukri was then taken to the bilik unit kawalan keselamatan penjara
(security control room) and made to sit on the floor handcuffed.
A prosecution witness, prisons officer Razali Fauzi, testified that he saw
Azhar putting on a pair of rubber gloves and kick and stomp Mohd Shukri in the
head and chest several times, causing the latter's head to hit against the
concrete wall and floor of the room.
Razali also testified that he saw blood oozing from Mohd Shukri's mouth.
Mohd Shukri went into a seizure and lapsed into a coma. He died on March
10, 2004, without regaining consciousness.

COURT-LOVE
KUALA LUMPUR, April 22 (Bernama) -- A construction worker who was said to be
involved in a love triangle was ordered by the High Court here today to enter
his defence on a charge of murdering his housemate three years ago.
Justice Datuk Mohamad Zabidin Mohd Diah made the order after ruling that the
prosecution had made out a prima facie case against R.Govindaraj, 34.
He also ordered that Govindaraj be sent for psychiatric observation at
Hospital Bahagia, Ulu Kinta, to determine whether he was of sound mind at the
time of the alleged offence after allowing defence counsel Joshua Sambathan's
application for a re-examination of Govindaraj's mental state.
Govindaraj is alleged to have mudered K. Daruma Rajan, 44 , who was also a
construction worker, at a squatter house in Kampung Sri Pakar, Salak South,
between 9pm on April 30, 2007, and 9am the following day.
Sambathan, in his application, said his client had twice undergone
psychiatric observation at the hospital.
According to the first report by psychiatric forensic consultant Dr Rabaiah
Mohd Salleh on Aug 27, 2007, she was unable to determine Govindaraj's mental
state because the latter was undergoing a personality change due to brain trauma
at that time, he said.
He said that in her second report on April 22 last year, Dr Rabaiah stated
that Govindaraj was fit to stand trial.
Deputy public prosecutor Yaacub Chik, in his submission at the end of the
prosecution's case, said there was intention to kill Daruma Rajan because the
four stab wounds and 16 injuries on his body and neck showed that there was
hatred for the deceased.
He said Govindaraj lived with Daruma Rajan and a woman who had romantic ties
with Govindaraj.
He said that although Govindaraj left the house after being ordered Daruma
Rajan to do so, he still maintained the relationship with the woman without the
latter's knowledge and met her in the house in his absence.
However, they started to grow apart and he told the woman that he was angry
with Daruma Rajan and wanted to poison him, Yaacub said.
Mohamad Zabidin fixed June 28 for hearing pending the psychiatric report on

Zaki Yasin allowed him to do so.
When the veteran lawyer pursued further with the questioning, Deputy
Public Prosecutor (DPP) Tun Abdul Majid Tun Hamzah stood up and said the
court had ruled in previous proceedings that Karpal could ask questions to
the witnesses through the court or through the DPP.
Tun Abdul Majid said that he had asked Karpal whether he had any
questions for Shaariibuu to answer but then, Karpal told the court that the
prosecution was ""unfriendly"" and that he would rather pose the questions
through the court.
At one point when both men were at each others' throat, Karpal, who is
wheelchair-bound, pointed at Tun Abdul Majid and told him to sit down.
Tun Abdul Majid raised his voice and responded angrily: ""What about
you? You cannot tell me to sit down.""
""You're very arrogant Tun Majid. You're showing your arrogance right
now,"" Karpal replied.
Mohd Zaki then stepped in to end the quarrel by telling Karpal to
respect Tun Abdul Majid and that he should not have told Tun Abdul Majid to
sit down.
Let there be no more heated exchanges between the DPPs and counsel in
the future, he said.

The six are aged between 30 and 40.
Penang CID chief SAC II Wan Abdullah Tunku Said said today, the missing
foreigners had been renting the house for the past six months.
""They are believed to have gone into hiding,"" he said, adding that a
post-mortem revealed that the unidentified victim had sustained four stab wounds
on the chest and neck.
Wan Abdullah urged those with information on events leading to the murder to
contact investigating officer ASP Mohd Ismail Jamaluddin at 04-2181822.
Meanwhile, MCA Legal Bureau applauded the Cabinet decision saying that it
would alleviate the constant and often repeated issue of conflict of juridiction

"MYANMAR NATIONAL FREED OF MURDER CHARGE
COURT-MYANMAR
KUALA LUMPUR, April 24 (Bernama) -- The High Court here today acquitted and
discharged a Myanmar national for the murder of his colleague six years ago.
Judicial Commissioner Zainal Azman Abdul Aziz ordered Yaw Nal to be freed
after finding that the prosecution failed to establish a prima facie case
against the accused.
In his judgment, Zainal Azman said Yaw had no intention to cause Lee Sze
Fong's death.
""There was no preparation made to cause Lee's death and the knife, which was
allegedly used to stab the victim, also was not found.
""It is unknown who actually stabs the victim or causes serious injury, where
testimonies by witnesses in the case showed that it was the deceased who started
the fight,"" he added.
He said a dying declaration made by Lee to a worker could also not be
accepted because there was no proof to show that the deceased was mentally alert
at that time.
Yaw, 40, was charged with culpable homicide not amounting to murder in Lee's
killing at No.70, Kg Air Leleh, Air Panas Setapak, at about 10.30pm on May 23,
2003.

"NINE COUSINS PLEAD GUILTY TO MURDER
COURT-COUSINS
SHAH ALAM, June 24 (Bernama) -- Nine relatives today pleaded guilty in the
High Court here to causing the death of their uncle, a restaurant owner, three
years ago.
All the men made the plea before Judicial Commissioner Siti Khadijah Sheikh
Hassan Badjenid after the amended charge under Section 149 of the Penal Code,
which is punishable under Section 304 (a) of the same Code, was read to them.
In 2007, they were charged for committing the offence under Section 149
of the Penal Code which is punishable under Section 302 of the same Code.
The accused were T.C. Letchumanan, 31; T.C. Anan Babu, 25; T.C. Rajanderan,
26 and T.C. Raja Segaran, 28; who were represented by counsel Roy Gingkoi.
A. Poovendren, 21, who was represented by Joshua Sambanthan, S.
Kumaraselvam, 22, and G. James, 23, were represented by K.A. Ramu; K.Bagavathy,
22, was represented by S.S. Ruban while V.Arvindran, 24, was represented by P.
Krishnan.
They, together with several others still at large, were charged with jointly
causing bodily injuries to R. Praphukumar, an Indian national, which led to his
death.
The accused were alleged to have caused the injuries to their uncle at
12.30am on March 3, 2008 in front of the 'Restoran Triple 8 Corner', Taman Segar
Perdana, Bt 9 Cheras, Selangor.
The facts of the case stated that Praphukumar suffered serious injuries in
the incident and was admitted to the Kajang Hospital and died several days later
on March 10, 2007.
A post mortem revealed that the cause of death was serious injuries to the
head.
When pleading for leniency for his four clients, Roy said the incident was
prompted by the action of the victim who was alleged to have molested his niece
who was working with him and who was also a sister to four of the accused.
Roy said Praphukumar became an uncle to his clients when their auntie
married the victim.
He said during the incident, all the accused had gone to the victim's
restaurant to ask him to apoligise to their younger sister but Praphukumar
refused and instead ordered them out.
He said that a struggle ensued which was later joined by a group of men.
Siti Khadijah fixed June 28 for K.A Ramu and P.Krishnan to submit mitigation
for their clients and submission by the Deputy Public Prosecutor Isa Hassim
before passing sentence.

"MALAYSIAN-BORN SURGEON MAKES BAIL PLEA OVER MURDER AND MANSLAUGHTER
MALAYSIAN-SURGEON
MELBOURNE, June 24 (Bernama) -- A Malaysian-born neurosurgeon charged with
murder and manslaughter of two high-class escorts is no longer in denial about
his vices, a court heard today.
Suresh Surendranath Nair, 42, had been on remand since January after
breaching bail conditions that forbid him from taking cocaine or being in the
company of sex-workers, The Australian newspaper reported.
Suresh is charged with murder over the death of Brazilian national Suellen
Domingues Zaupa, 22, in November, and manslaughter for the death of Victoria
McIntyre, 23 in February last year.
Both women worked as escorts and died in Suresh's Elizabeth Bay apartment
in Sydney's east, from an overdose of cocaine, which was allegedly supplied by
the neurosurgeon, the newspaper said.
At a Supreme Court bail hearing in Sydney, psychiatrist Dr Rosalie Wilcox
said Suresh was no longer in denial about his addictions and since being in
custody had had ""more time to think about how his addiction led to the
destruction of his life and other lives as well.''
""I believe now that he has been in custody for six months that denial has
been well and truly confronted,'' the newspaper quoted Dr Wilcox as telling the
court.
Dr Wilcox described Suresh as ""a loner'' who may appear that he is ""above
himself'' -- a perception that could have led to him being ""savagely''
bashed while on remand at Long Bay Jail.
If released on bail, Suresh could undertake a three-week rehabilitation
programme at The Sydney Clinic, before finding a more permanent residential
treatment facility, his barrister Peter Hamill told Justice Megan Latham.
But Crown prosecutor Terry Thorpe said he was concerned that Suresh could
escape from the clinic, rent a motel room, buy cocaine and call up some
escorts.
Justice Latham reserved her decision on Nair's bail until Tuesday.

"ALTANTUYA MURDER TRIAL ENTERS 100TH DAY
ALTANTUYA-100 DAYS
SHAH ALAM, March 25 (Bernama) -- The murder trial of Mongolian Altantuya
Shaariibuu entered its 100th day today.
The brutal murder which occurred two years ago shocked the nation as it
involved the use of explosives which are normally used by security forces, to
blow up her body.
What became more shocking were the arrests of well-known political analyst
Abdul Razak Abdullah Baginda and two members of the police Special Action Squad
(UTK), who used to accompany the prime minister and deputy prime minister on
their trips, in connection with the murder and followed by their trial in the
Shah Alam High Court until now.
The hearing involving more than 70 witnesses is before judge Datuk Mohd
Zaki Md Yasin, with the investigating officers giving their evidence now,
indicating that the prosecution's case could end soon.
The proceedings had in fact begun earlier in the Magistrate's Court before
the case was transferred to the High Court, which also involved a change of the
presiding judge, deputy public prosecutor and counsel.
Judge Datuk K.N. Segara was slated to hear the case when it was transferred
to the Kuala Lumpur High Court which saw all the accused pleading not guilty to
the charges.
Chief Inspector Azilah Hadri, 32, and Corporal Sirul Azhar Umar, 37, both
members of the UTK, are charged with murdering Altantuya, 28, between 10pm on
Oct 19, 2006 and 1am the following day in an area in Bukit Raja, near here,
while Abdul Razak is charged with abetting them in the murder.
Earlier, the legal fraternity and public were shocked when Abdul Razak who
was then represented by lawyer Datuk Muhammad Shafee Abdullah was allowed by
Kuala Lumpur High Court judge Datuk Abdul Kadir Musa to be released on a RM1
million bond although murder cases are not bailable.
This was the second of such situation involving Muhammad Shafee as in
another case, his client lawyer Datuk Balwant Singh a/l Sewa Singh also
obtained the same ""privilege"". However, Abdul Razak managed to enjoy the
freedom only for a while as he was re-arrested after judge Segara rejected his
application to extend the freedom and he was sent to Sungai Buloh Prison with
the other two accused.
In place of Muhammad Shafee, Abdul Razak hired lawyer Wong Kian Kheong who
submitted a shocking affidavit in which Abdul Razak admitted having a love
affair with Altantuya that took them to Shanghai, Kuala Lumpur and Paris.
The affidavit also stated that Abdul Razak knew Azilah after being
introduced to him by DSP Musa Safri, and that Azilah had assured him that he
could solve the harassment by Altantuya at his house after his (Abdul Razak's)
refusal to continue giving her money.
Wong who was dubbed ""Mr No Comment"" by media members covering the case, was
repeatedly reminded by judge Segara not to submit the affidavit but he was
adamant, hoping to avoid his client being held in prison throughout the
duration of the trial.
The case was then put before judge Mohd Zaki on June 4, 2007 as judge
Segara  had several cases pending which could delay the Altantuya murder case
hearing.
The start of the proceeding before Mohd Zaki also had a situation that
raised eyebrows -- the tussle between lawyers Shaun Tan Kee Shaan and Zulkifli
Nordin to represent Azilah. However, both were not picked by Azilah as he
decided to hire lawyers J. Kuldeep Kumar and Datuk Hazman Ahmad to represent
him instead.
There was another controversy when it was revealed that former head of the
Classified Case Unit Salehuddin Saidin, who was prosecuting in the case, was
seen playing badminton with judge Mohd Zaki, resulting in him being replaced by
DPP Tun Abdul Majid Tun Hamzah, who was only informed about it the day before.
The change of DPP caused Mohd Zaki to postpone the hearing to three weeks
later to enable Tun Abdul Majid to prepare for the case together with DPPs
Noorin Badaruddin, Manoj Kurup and Hanim Rashid.
In the early stage of the hearing, the prosecution called a number of UTK
members including Azilah and Sirul Azhar's superiors like the unit's deputy
commander ACP Mastor Mohd Ariff, training officer DSP M.V. Sri Kumar and
bomb expert DSP Muhammad Koey Abdullah who said that UTK members were like
""robots"" in taking orders.
Negligence in recording the issuance and return of arms and ammunitions
including explosives at the UTK also shocked the public, raising questions from
the prosecution on the possibility of Azilah and Sirul Azhar keeping arms and
explosives.
The testimonies of witnesses from Celcom also made an impact at the hearing
when all four testified that its transmission station could detect Azilah at
the scene of the murder and his frequent communication with the other two
accused.
The pathologist who testified at the hearing also managed to put together
the bone fragments with multiple cracks found at the murder scene. Although the
skeleton was incomplete, it was enough for the forensic expert to ascertain
that the shattered bones were from a human body and with DNA matching, that it
belonged to Altantuya.
Meanwhile, the public's attention and fascination for the case has somewhat
waned, not like in the beginning when media members and curious individuals
jostled to get into the courtroom, with some waiting in line as early as 5am
although the courtroom doors were only opened four hours later.
Lawyer Karpal Singh, who is holding a watching brief for Altantuya's family
and the Mongolian government, is also no longer seen at the hearing these days,
compared to the early stage where he even fervently asked the court that he be
allowed to participate and ask questions.
Tun Abdul Majid when met by Bernama said he had followed a case hearing
longer than this, but it is the longest for Noorin since joining the DPP's
office.
Abdul Razak who has been in jail for 15 months now has lost some weight but
still appears cheerful, perhaps due to his family's presence, especially his
parents' on each day of hearing.
He said: ""It's enough if God wants to punish me...I am not guilty.""
His every move draws attention. On a number of occasions he was seen
sobbing and hugging his family members. He had also been seen angrily kicking
the dock and shouting at no one in particular.
He had once asked Bernama why the media was so interested in the case but
when told that ""you are among the remarkable personalities in Malaysia, hence
you draw attention"", he just smiled.
His family who previously were not that friendly with the media, now seem
to understand the work of the media and accept their presence, and even
exchange views on various issues.
Azilah, who has a supportive girlfriend to keep his spirits up, has
frequently said he wanted the case to end as soon as possible while Sirul Azhar
remains quiet.
The prosecution is at the final stage before judge Mohd Zaki makes his
decision, probably in May.

Tonny said Idris briefly told him about the harassment by three women and a
Chinese man at Abdul Razak's house, after which he contacted Ang (his phone
number given to him by Abdul Razak) and he came to the police station to give a
statement.
Tonny said that on Oct 26, 2006, he also received a call from an officer
from the Jalan Traverse police station regarding a report about a foreign woman
believed to have been abducted.
Tonny, the 75th prosecution witness in the Altantuya murder trial, was

Chief Inspector Azilah Hadri, 32, and Corporal Sirul Azhar Umar, 37, both
from the police Special Action Squad (UTK), are charged with murdering
Altantuya, 28, between 10pm on Oct 19, 2006 and 1am the next day in an area in

Abdul Razak, 48, is charged with abetting them in the murder.
Earlier, Altantuya's cousin Namiraa Gerelmaa testified that she had

She also admitted lodging the police report when Altantuya failed to return
to her hotel room after going out to meet Abdul Razak.

Mageswari said that based on the evidence of all eight witnesses in the
inquest, the court did not suspect and dismissed the possibility that the
murder was due to the deceased's business, political or personal problems.
According to the investigating officer, the murder had links with a robbery
of a Southern Bank branch in Petaling Jaya on May 18, 2001.
""He said the robbers who robbed Southern Bank in Petaling Jaya on May 18,
2001 were also involved in Dr Joe Fernandez's murder.

According to the suspect, he and three other men had taken part in the plan
to kill Dr Fernandez but two of them were shot dead when robbing the bank, she

"388 BONE FRAGMENTS FOUND AT ALTANTUYA MURDER SCENE
Court-Altantuya
SHAH ALAM, Feb 26 (Bernama) -- The High Court here today was told that 388
human bone fragments were found at the site where Mongolian woman Altantuya
Shaariibuuu was said to have been blown up two years ago.
Kuala Lumpur Hospital Forensic Department Head Dr Mohd Shah Mahmood, 48,
said the fragments included those of the ribs, spine and neck were found in a
clearing and shrubs on a hill.
He said tissue pieces and hair were also found but not as much as the bone
fragments probably because they had decayed.
""When entering the shrubs, bone fragments were found on the ground and
hanging from tree branches were mostly skin pieces and hair. In the clearing,
bone fragments and tissue pieces were found on the ground,"" he said.
He said two days were taken to search for evidence at the scene but he did
not find any human flesh or blood.
He said the first inspection was carried out on Nov 7, 2006 while the
second two days later on his own request on the belief that more bone fragments
would be found.
Dr Mohd Shah said this when examined by Deputy Public Prosecutor Tun Abdul
Majid Tun Hamzah on the 92nd of trial involving C/Insp Azilah Hadri, 32, and
Cpl Sirul Azhar Umar, 37, of the police's Special Action Unit who are charged
with murdering Altantuya, 28, between 10pm on Oct 19, 2006 and 1am the
following day at an area in Bukit Raja.
Political analyst Abdul Razak Abdullah Baginda, 48, is charged with
abetting them.
Dr Mohd Shah said that after returning from the scene on Nov 7, 2006 about
5pm, he conducted tests on the bone fragments and tissue pieces to look for
traces of explosive materials.
He did not conduct any test the next day because he wanted to refer to Dr
Nurliza Abdullah who was a forensic anthropologist.
""I had to refer to Dr Nurliza to determine the age, gender, types of
injury and so on and to get help from x-ray expert Dr Zaleha Abdul Manaf,"" he
said.
He said many small bone fragments were found scattered at the scene on the
second day of inspection and had discussed with Supt Amidon Anan dan DSP
Muhammad Koey Abdullah on the possible cause.
""In my opinion, a powerful explosive caused injury to the bone and turned
it into small fragments of various sizes which were scattered in the area,"" Dr
Mohd Shah said.
Tun Abdul Majid: ""What about the spine It was there intact. Can you
explain""
Dr Mohd Shah: ""There were two possibilities.
""Firstly, it was bigger and heavier. It could not be go far. Secondly, the
deceased was lying on its back so the spine was the closest to the face of the
ground. The power of the explosion placed on the chest pressed the bone to the
face of the ground.""
Meanwhile in the morning proceedings, Amidon of the police's Forensic
Department was recalled to answer questions pertaining to a picture published
by The Star daily on Feb 10 showing him holding an object resembling a human
skull.
Amidon said the picture was taken by the roadside near Genting Higlands

MUSA-FERNANDEZ
JOHOR BAHARU, April 26 (Bernama) -- Unless there are witnesses or new

Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Musa Hassan said without witnesses or
new leads, the police could not charge the culprit in court.
""This case is closed unless there are witnesses coming forward to say he or
she saw the incident. I cannot use statements of an accused to charge him in

He commenting on the coroner's court ruling for the police to continue
with the probe to identify the killer and ascertain the motive of the killing.
Musa said a gun had been found and ballistic tests showed it had been used
to kill Dr Fernandez but it was only a forensic evidence.
Coroner M. Mageswari, in declaring an open verdict at the end of the
inquest into the murder in Bukit Mertajam yesterday, said the police should
identify the killer and the motive of the murder.
She said there was a need to get to the bottom of the case as the
investigating officer had testified that a suspect in a Southern Bank robbery
in Petaling Jaya on May 18, 2001, had in his cautioned statement admitted that
he and three friends had planned to kill Dr Fernandez.
While two of the suspect's friends were killed in the robbery, there were
no other witnesses to the murder.

"YOUTH'S DEATH PENALTY FOR BUSINESSMAN'S MURDER UPHELD
COURT-HERZOG
PUTRAJAYA, April 26 (Bernama) -- Low Kian Boon will hang for the murder
of German-born Australian Hans Herzog after losing his appeal against conviction
and sentence in Federal Court here here today while his co-accused, who was a
juvenile then, will be detained at the pleasure of the sultan.
The order was made today by Chief Judge of Sabah and Sarawak Tan Sri Richard
Malanjum and Federal Court judges Datuk Seri James Foong Cheng Yuen and Datuk
Heliliah Yusof who unanimously upheld the Court of Appeal's decision.
Low, 24, and the juvenile, who is now 23 years old, were initially charged
with murdering Herzog, 59, at his home in Taman Subang Mewah in Subang Jaya,
Selangor between 12.30am and 12.45am on Nov 12, 2003.
However, the Shah Alam High Court convictedon them of a lesser charge of
manslaughter and sentenced them to 10 years' imprisonment in 2004 after ruling
that the prosecution had failed to prove their intention to cause death.
The Court of Appeal last year allowed the prosecution's appeal to reverse
the High Court's decision.
Meanwhile, Herzog's step-daughters, aged 16 and 14 (at the time of the
incident), were also charged with the offence but were acquitted and discharged
by the Shah Alam High Court on Feb 6, 2006, without calling for their defence
after finding that there was no evidence that the girls had common intention to
kill Herzog.
Heliliah, in her decision today, ruled that the Court of Appeal was right
to disturb the findings of the High Court which had concluded that there was no
intention on the part of the duo to kill the businessman.
She agreed with the Court of Appeal's ruling that the duo intended to kill
Herzog, based on the evidence of 23 slash wounds found on Herzog and also
evidence that the attack was pre-planned where two parang were bought.
Low was represented by counsel Edmund Bon, while the juvenile was
represented by Datuk Seri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah. Deputy public prosecutor
Ahmad Bache appeared for the prosecution.

POLICE-REPORT
PETALING JAYA, Sept 26 (Bernama) -- The main suspect in the murder of
cosmetics queen Datuk Sosilawati Lawiya and three others lodged a police
report today, alleging police brutality while under remand.
The 41-year-old who filed a report at the Petaling Jaya police
headquarters, was escorted by several policemen and watched closely by
his two lawyers, Ravi Nekoo and Pushpa Ratnam.
The suspect was seen entering the police headquarters at 4.15pm before
leaving
about an hour later, in a police car.
According to the report, the suspect alleged he was kicked and assaulted by
policemen using a rubber hose, as well as hit on his private parts with a stick.
He said he was also forced to perform 60 repetitive squat stands until
he passed out, adding that he was also forced to admit and point his finger
involuntarily to where a murder victim's mobile phone was thrown.
Meanwhile, Nekoo said the police were cooperative and allowed the suspect to
make a report on police mistreatment which resulted in back injuries.
""He (suspect) claimed to have been slapped and beaten until his front teeth
became loose, and even experienced back pains...the suspect will be sent to the
hospital for treatment but the date and hospital have not been confirmed.
""The suspect claimed he was not involved in the murder...however, he is
ready to help the police in any way but hopes to be treated better and fairly,""
he told reporters outside the police headquarters.
On Sept 23, D. P. Vijandran, who is one of the suspect's lawyers, alleged
that his client was hit and kicked, resulting in body injuries.
The matter was made known by his client during Vijandran's first visit with
his two clients, which lasted 15 minutes, at the Kuala Lumpur police contingent
headquarters.
Subsequently, Bukit Aman CID director Datuk Seri Mohd Bakri Zinin told the
suspect to file a police report, should they be abused or forced to sign
documents by the police team during their remand period to enable a thorough
investigation.
Sosilawati, 47, her driver, Kamaruddin Shamsuddin, 44, Kampung Baru, Kuala
Lumpur CIMB bank officer Noorhisham Mohammad, 38, and personal lawyer Ahmad
Kamil Abd Karim, 32, were reported missing since Aug 30 after they were said to
have gone to Banting over a land transaction.
On Sept 13, police confirmed that the four victims were beaten to death
before
their bodies were burnt and the ashes scattered into a river near Ladang Gadong,
Banting, Selangor.
In BANTING, a source linked to the investigations of these murders termed
the Banting murders by the press, told reporters that no bodies were found at
two locations police had identfied as graves at Ladong Gadong.
He only said police appeared to be satisfied to have found some evidence but
did not wish to disclose if they were bone fragments or personal effects of
victims.
He was only willing to say that the find provided leads in the case of
missing Kedah businessman Mohd Shafik Abdullah.
Mohd Shafik, who hails from Sungei Petani, is also believed to have been
murdered by the same people as in the Sosilawati case.
Asked about the presence of fire and rescue personnel and fire engines at
the scene, he said they were there to assist in providing water supply for the
investigation team and that the assistance of Syabas was also sought to repair
broken mains in the area.
Pressmen who had staked out the area from early morning till 6.55pm did not
see police Land Rovers bringing out any body bags as is normally witnessed in
murders and neither was there the stench of decaying corpses.

SHAH ALAM, May 27 (Bernama) -- The High Court here today dismissed an appeal
by murder accused Mohafri Mohamed to review a Magistrate's Court decision to
reject his application for a discharge not amounting to an acquittal.
Judge Datuk Wira Mohtarudin Baki dismissed the application by Mohafri,37, a
former catering manager charged with murdering his wife Fazlina Ahmad, 38, a
company executive.
Mohafri filed an appeal against the rejection for a discharge not amounting
to an acquittal by magistrate Wan Karimah Wan Md Ab Ghani on March 19 as she had
no jurisdiction to do so.
His counsel Zainal Ithnin argued that the defence had applied for a review
of the rejection by the magistrate and that it was not an appeal.
He said the prosecution told the magistrate (on Feb 19 and March 19) that
since the chemist and autopsy reports were not ready, Mohafri should be
discharged not amounting to an acquittal.
""The magistrate who cited lack of jurisdiction as reason for rejecting our
application contravened Section 29 of Criminal Procedure Code which states that
the magistrate is empowered to release the accused. This is why a review is
needed,"" he added.
Deputy public prosecutor Rosidah Abu Bakar said the prosecution objected to
the appeal as it contravened Section 307 of Criminal Procedure Code as the
magistrate's court did not make a decision.
""The application should have been made under Section 323 of Criminal
Procedure Code that is a review.  The chemist and autopsy reports are being
issued and I ask that the application be dismissed,"" she added.
On Jan 18, Mohafri was charged at the Ampang Magistrate's Court under
Section 302 of the Penal Code for the murder of his wife Fazlina at 70, Jalan
Pinggiran 2 in Taman Pinggiran Ukay, Ampang, on Dec 30 last year.
He is alleged to have committed the offence between 5am to 10.30am. No plea

"TRADER SENT TO THE GALLOWS FOR NEIGHBOUR'S MURDER
COURT-HANG
GEORGE TOWN, Oct 27 (Bernama) --The Penang High Court here today sentenced
to death by hanging a trader after finding him guilty of murdering his neighbour
four years ago.
Justice Datuk Abdul Halim Aman made the decision after finding that the
prosecution had succeeded in establishing the case beyond reasonable doubts and
that the testimony by the accused, Omar Shaari, 49, was merely a denial.
Omar, from Perak, but ran a tomato rice business at Taman Tun Sardon here,
was charged with murdering Faridah Mohd Shariff, 46, at a house at Jalan Datuk
Keramat here between 11am and 2pm on Sept 12, 2006.
In his written judgment, Abdul Halim said Omar, who was represented by
lawyer N.Ahilan had clearly made fictitious stories and attempted to shift the
burden by saying that Faridah was killed by his assistant, Farouk  Khan, 25, a
Myanmar national.
""The evidence by the accused in his defence is full of doubts. His action in
trying to shift the burden to Farouk Khan cannot be accepted.
""How can an illegal immigrant pull and throw the victim's body into a
secondary forest alone when he does not even know Faridah.
""To carry the victim's body that far, he will need a car and actually, it
was the accused who masterminded the crime and Farouk Khan only acted as
assistant.
""This is evident from a witness testimony who saw a car in front of the
accused's house on the day of the incident,"" he added.
Abdul Halim said the evidence by the accused's two wives, who testified as
defence witnesses, also did not disparage the evidence by the prosecution key
witnesses.
Their evidence were merely an explanation to prove that their husband had no
financial problems and they were able to make profits from their business, he
added.
Omar smiled and said: ""Nasiblah"" (Its my misfortune) when Abdul Halim handed
down the sentence.
His wife fainted while walking towards him and Omar was seen beside her,
stroking her head, until she regained consciousness.
Deputy public prosecutor Arik Zakri Abdul Kadir prosecuted.

SEREMBAN, April 28 (Bernama) -- A 60-year-old woman cried hysterically when
her two sons were sentenced to death by the High Court here today for killing a
mechanic four years ago.
The accused, B. Ramesh, 30, and his brother, Suthar, 28, showed no emotion
when their mother cried her heart out and was taken out of the courtroom by
relatives.
The two were found guilty of killing R. Krishnan, 31, between 9.50pm on Feb

They were charged with another man still at large.
Ramesh and Suthar were sentenced to death under Section 302 of the Penal
Code, which was read with Section 304 of the same Code.
Judge Datuk Ahmad Nafsy Yasin in his judgment said the brothers had failed
to defend themselves and to cooperate with the police during the initial
stage of the investigation.
Instead, he said, the duo had fabricated two male characters, namely ""Joe""
and ""Raja"" who they claimed had attacked them and the victim.
""They also blamed the victim's wife and alleged she was the mastermind
of the murder after her husband found out about her affair with Ramesh.
""The brothers' blood were also found on the hammer and knife found in the
victim's car,"" he said.
The condition of the victim's car, which was ransacked and smeared with

GANI-SOSILAWATI
PUTRAJAYA, Sept 28 (Bernama) -- Attorney-General Tan Sri Abdul Gani Patail
today expressed his concern over the investigation into the murders of Datuk
Sosilawati and three others being blown out of proportion.
He said this was due to statements made by several parties on the case,
while the media should report only on facts without the extras because it would
jeopardise the case.
""I think they should follow what the IGP (Inspector-General of Police Tan
Sri Ismail Omar) has advised. Cool it down and let us do our work.
""I think at the right time, when they (police) have completed their
investigation, they will issue a proper statement and disclose everything. There
is no problem with that,"" he told reporters after attending the Malaysian
Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC)'s Aidilfitri celebration, here, today.
Also present were Minister in the Prime Minister's Department Datuk Seri
Mohamed Nazri Aziz and MACC chief commissioner Datuk Abu Kassim Mohamed.
He was asked whether the interference, with many parties including the
family of the missing Indian businessman, coming forward to make statements,
would harm the case.
Last Sunday, Ismail reminded the media not to write speculative stories on
the cases, but to wait for confirmation from the police.
His reminder came in the wake of media reports that two graves had been
found at the farm where the Banting murders had allegedly taken place.
Sosilawati, 47, her driver Kamaruddin Shansudin, 44, lawyer Ahmad Kamil
Abdul Karim, 32, and CIMB bank officer Noorhisham Mohammad, 38, who were
reported missing on Aug 30 after they had gone to Banting, Selangor, over a
land deal, were killed, their bodies burnt and the ashes thrown into rivers in
the vicinity of Ladang Gadong, near Banting, according to police.
The police recovered bones and other items from the rivers and had picked up
eight people, two of them lawyers, to facilitate their investigation into the
murders.
Asked if his office could assure the public that there would be results at
the end of the investigation, Abdul Gani said: ""As far as I'm concerned, in all
investigations, something will happen, either we charge or don't charge. That is
very definite.""
On the investigation papers that had been returned to the police, he said
there was no deadline for them to hand over the papers.
""I've got to wait for them to send (the investigation papers). Let them

possible. I'm meeting them on a regular basis. In fact, almost daily,"" he said.

KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 28 (Bernama) -- Lawyer Ravi Nekoo, who is representing
two lawyer brothers detained in connection with the murder of cosmetics
millionaire Datuk Sosilawati Lawiya and three others, is still in the dark over
the fate of his clients.
He is unsure when, or if, the two clients, and six other people -- linked to
the four murders -- would be charged in court.
""My clients' remand orders will expire on Saturday. I have a hunch they may
(either) be charged on Friday, or the police may decide to produce them before a
magistrate to extend the remand,"" Ravi told Bernama today.
He said since his clients, aged 38 and 41, are currently held under custody
of
the Selangor police contingent, he would write to acting Selangor Criminal
Investigation Department chief Assistant Commissioner Omar Mammah to enable him
(Nekoo) and another counsel to have access to the suspects.
""So far, only once, the police had granted us access to our clients, and
also
to their wives...but we want to meet them without the presence of police
officers,"" he added.
Ravi pointed out that the law was very clear on the issue, as under Section
28A(5) of the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC), it allowed counsel to have access
within sight of police officers, but not hearing.
""In other words, they (police) can witness when we are talking to our
clients
but they can't follow the conversation.
""We need complete privacy in this matter, which was denied during the first
visit,"" he disclosed.
He said the police were relying on Section 28A(8) of the CPC by saying that
the defence counsels might tamper with evidence, or fear the suspects might
abscond.
Sosilawati, 47, her driver, Kamaruddin Shamsuddin, 44, lawyer Ahmad Kamil
Abdul Karim, 32, and CIMB Bank officer Noorhisham Mohammad, 38, went missing on
Aug 30, after they had gone to Banting, Selangor over a land deal.
On Sept 12, police confirmed that the four were killed, their bodies burnt
and the ashes strewn in rivers near Ladang Gadong, Tanjung Sepat near Banting.
""They already had more than 14 days in gathering evidence from the
suspects...now, let us have access to our clients,"" said Ravi, who also asked
the police to allow the six other suspects in the case to have access to

Currently, he said, only his wife, Pushpa Ratnam, and he were in the defence

Hospital in Klang on Oct 26 last year.
Earlier during submission, deputy public prosecutor Idham Abd Ghani said if

Crime Scene Investigation (CSI) team leader from the Bukit Aman forensics
laboratory, Supt Amidon Anan, said that was the reason the operation was
halted.
He said the thick undergrowth also hampered the team from entering the
area.
""It was also because Chief Inspector Nizam and Sergeant Ismail (who are in
the team) were not able to hear the honk of a vehicle, which was to gauge the
distance the team was in the forest, that was parked outside the forest
area.
""When they could not hear the honk, I ordered them to come out of the area
for fear that they would get lost and to avoid having to conduct an operation to
rescue them,"" he added.

Action Squad, face the charge of murdering her between 10pm on Oct 19, 2006 and

Members of the media and Abdul Razak's family members also went on the

was not meticulous, Amidon agreed.
Meanwhile, Mustafa Umat, 39, the auxiliary policeman at the Tasik Subang dam,

heard explosions like those from firecrackers and bamboo cannons.
He said the sound did not come from the direction of the hilly area, but
from a village nearby and that he had also seen several people entering the
forest area to look for bamboo.

Muntik Bani, will be released or sentenced to death.
Judge Mohd Yazid Mustafa fixed the date after hearing submissions from
deputy public prosecutor Mohd Dusuki Mokhtar and lawyer V.Rajehgopal at the end
of the defence case.
During the trial, which began on Jan 18, the court heard testimonies from 50
prosecution witnesses and one defence witness.
Murugan, a sugar cane juice seller, was charged with committing the offence
at his house in Jalan Datuk Yusof Shahbudin 6, Taman Sentosa, Klang between Oct
18 and Oct 20 last year.
He was charged under Section 302 of the Penal Code, which carries the
mandatory death sentence upon conviction.
Muntik, who hailed from Surabaya, died at the Tengku Ampuan Rahimah Hospital
in Klang on Oct 26 last year.
Earlier, Rajehgopal said the victim's dying declaration (based on actions on
her) was contradictory, so it could not be associated with the cause of her
death, that was due to back injury and infection in the right leg.
He said there was no clear evidence showing that the injuries were inflicted
by Murugan between Oct 18 and 20 last year as prosecution witnesses told the
court they had seen the accused slapped and kicked the victim.
""As such, the accused managed to raise reasonable doubts on the prosecution
case while the prosecution failed to prove the case beyond reasonable doubts
based on the evidence as a whole,"" said Rajehgopal.
In his submission, Mohd Dusuki said Murugan's defence was merely a denial
which did not hold water and was inconsistence.
Among other things, Mohd Dusuki said the accused denied that he locked
Muntik in the toilet or abused her by hitting and kicking her, and did not give
her food and drinks during the confinement.
""The accused's defence ran contrary to all evidence as a whole and his
evidence should at least be supported by other evidence to strengthen it as well
as his credibility or at least to raise reasonable doubts on the prosecution
case,"" he added.

SHAH ALAM, July 29 (Bernama) --  The prosecution in the murder trial of
lorry attendant M. Rajamorgan, who is accused of killing 18-month-old infant K.
Haresvarra, today handed over the documents required by the defence counsel.
Deputy Public Prosecutor Alfred Agin said documents such as the chemistry
and autopsy reports had been handed over when the case was mentioned at the High
Court, here today.
Agin said High Court Senior Assistant Registrar, Mohd Fadhly  Yaacob, later
fixed Sept 1 as the date for re-mention of the case as the defence needed more
time to scrutinize the documents before deciding whether they would make a
representation on behalf of their client.
If the defence team, comprising Amer Hamzah Arshad and N. Surendran, wished
to make a representation, they must do so on that date. Rajamorgan, 33, is
charged under Section 302 of the Penal Code which carries the mandatory death
sentence upon conviction.
He is alleged to have killed Haresvarra between 9.40pm and 10.10pm on March
3 at the Vista Damansara Apartment children's playground at Jalan Kenanga, Kg
Sungai Kayu Ara, Petaling Jaya.
The accused was first charged at the Petaling Jaya Magistrate's Court on

"PVR AMONG TWO IN KIDNAP-CUM-MURDER OF SRI LANKAN
POLICE-KIDNAP
KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 29 (Bernama) -- A police volunteer reserve (PVR) and his
accomplice have been arrested in connection with the kidnapping of three Sri
Lankan nationals, one of whom was tortured to death while the ransom was
negotiated.
The PVR, attached to the Brickfields police headquarters, and the
accomplice,
were nabbed during a raid on a house at a workers quarters behind the Cempaka
flats in Pinggiran Batu Caves late last night.
Initial police investigations have revealed the PVR might have masterminded
the
kidnapping.
Gombak police deputy chief Superintendent Rosli Hassan said the murder
victim
was found naked and handcuffed inside a van in front of the house.
He said the deceased's compatriot who sustained broken legs, was also found
in
the vehicle.
The other Sri Lankan was found in the house with the two suspects at the
time
of the raid, he added.
""We do not rule out the possibility that the suspects were trying to dispose
off the body of the dead man before taking one of the remaining Sri Lankans to a
bank to withdraw an unspecified amount of money as ransom to secure their
release,"" said Rosli.
He said blood stains were found splattered on the floor in one of the rooms
of the house, adding that the police seized a car, handcuffs and mobile phones
belonging to the suspected kidnappers.
Rosli said initial investigations revealed the three Sri Lankans were picked
up by the suspects at an airport, three days ago, before being taken to a hotel.
""We believe the foreigners were tourists or job seekers...we are in the
midst of determining their identities,"" he said.
The suspects, aged 30 and 32, have been remanded for seven days to
facilitate investigations under Section 302 of the Penal Code for murder.
The body of the murder victim was sent to the Selayang Hospital. His

"SELLER OF RELIGIOUS BOOKS ACQUITED OF MURDER
COURT-MURDER
KUALA TERENGGANU, 29 Nov (Bernama) -- A part-time seller of religious books
was acquitted of murder today after the High Court here found him mentally
unsound when he committed the act in May last year.
Judge Datuk Abdul Rahim Uda made the decision after he was satisfied with
the defence argument that Zulkifli Mamat, 43, from Gong Limau Kemaman was not of
sound mind when he killed 79-year-old Muda Mat.
Zulkifli, who was handcuffed in the dock, had been asked to make his defence
after Deputy Public Prosecutor Jazamuddin Ahmad Nazawi established a prima facie
case against him.
According to the charge sheet, Zulkifli killed Muda in front of a
half-completed shop house beside Jalan Kampung Darat Penunjuk in Kijal Kemaman
at about 6pm on May 12 last year.
The accused chose to remain silent before his counsel, Abdullah Mohamad,
called to the stand Consultant Psychiatrist of the Permai Hospital in Johor
Bharu Bari'ah Yahya.
Bari'ah said that medical records from the Sultanah Nur Zahirah Hospital and
the Kemaman Hospital as well as interviews with family members confirmed that
Zulkifli had suffered from epilepsy from childhood.
She said that he only started receiving treatment in his teens.
""Following the disease, the accused underwent a personality change and
easily lost his temper and acted aggressively even when the provocation was
slight without thinking that what he was doing was against the law,"" she said.
She said that Zulkifli had acted aggressively against his own family and had
gone into a rage when awaiting his turn to be treated.
Bari'ah said that his condition had worsened since 10 years ago when he
ceased to stay with his family and did not take his medication regularly.
She said the murder happened because the accused had not received the proper
treatment, which he needed continually.
The court found that Zulkifli had committed the murder but that he was
mentally incapable of understanding that what he was doing was against the law.
Abdul Rahim then ordered him to be detained at Marang Prison for supervision
and treatment while awaiting directions from Permai Hospital and for his release
with the consent of the Sultan of Terengganu.

"NAJIB WILL NOT ISSUE STATEMENT ON ALTANTUYA MURDER CASE - AIDE
Najib-Altantuya (Exclusive)
KUALA LUMPUR, June 30 (Bernama) -- Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak will not
issue any statement on the claim by a witness linking the picture of the
deputy prime minister in the on-going murder trial of a Mongolian model,
Altantuya Shaariibuu, at the Shah Alam High Court as it could be subjudice
to the case.
His press secretary Datuk Tengku Sarifuddin Tengku Ahmad, however, said
Najib was maintaining his statements made several times before that he had
never met or known Altantuya, 28, and was not involved in the case.
""I wish to make it clear that the deputy prime minister had on several
occasions when interviewed by the media previously and during the Ijok
by-election had said that he had never met and known Altantuya and was not
involved in the case.
""As such, the issue over the picture does not arise.
""This brief clarification is made because media reports on yesterday's
proceedings of the court case have given rise to various views and
statements by certain parties that could affect public opinion on the
deputy prime minister,"" Tengku Sarifuddin said in a statement to Bernama
today.
In the high-profile murder trial yesterday, Altantuya's cousin, Burmaa
Oyunchimeg, 26, told the court that she had seen a picture of Altantuya
having a meal in the same table with political analyst Abdul Razak Baginda,
46, and a Malaysian government official who is known by the name of ""Najib
Razak"" and several others.
Burmaa, also known as Amy, said Altantuya showed her the picture when
they were in Hong Kong after the Mongolian beauty returned from France.
Replying to lawyer Karpal Singh, who is holding a watching brief for
Altantuya's family, Burmaa, the sixth prosecution witness, said Altantuya
mentioned that the Malaysian government official's name was Najib Razak and
she could remember the name because it was similar to Abdul Razak's.
However, the picture in question was not shown in court.
When campaigning in the Ijok state by-election in April, Najib had
repeatedly denied his involvement in the Mongolian model's case and had
also chided the opposition for resorting to character assassination
strategy by making wild accusations including linking him to the
Altantuya's case.
Najib said all parties including Prime Minister Datuk Seri Abdullah
Ahmad Badawi knew the actual situation.
Chief Inspector Azilah Hadri, 30, and Corporal Sirul Azhar Umar, 35,
from the police special action unit, are charged with murdering Altantuya
at lots between 12843 and 16735 in Mukim Bukit Raja at Shah Alam between
10pm on Oct 19 and 1am on Oct 20 last year.
Abdul Razak is charged with abetting the policemen between 9.54am on
Oct 18 and 9.45pm on Oct 19 last year. The three face the death sentence if
convicted.
Following is the full statement by Tengku Sarifuddin to Bernama:
1. I wish to refer to today's media reports on a witness' testimony on
a picture (not shown in court) of Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib
Tun Razak in the murder trial of Mongolian model Altantuya.
2. Since the trial is in progress and any statement might be subjudice
to the case, it is not appropriate for the deputy prime minister to comment
on the matter.
3. Nevertheless, In wish to clarify that the deputy prime minister had
on several occasions when interviewed by the media before and during the
Ijok by-election had stated that he had never met or known the victim and
was not involved in the case. As such, the issue over the picture does not
arise.
4. The brief clarification is made because media reports on yesterday's

being beaten with a blunt object.
However, she said in their submissions, the prosecution depended merely on
circumstantial evidence and statements taken from key witnesses like Chen's

"LABOURER GETS 10 YEARS JAIL FOR RAPE
Court-Rape
KUALA TERENGGANU, Feb 1 (Bernama) -- A labourer was today ordered to
serve 10 years and six months in jail and given six strokes of the rotan by
the Session's Court here after he was found guilty of raping a girl, who
was then aged 14 years and 11 months.
Judge Zainal Azman Abdul Aziz ordered Rosdi Mamat, 25, from Kampung
Padang Luas Dalam, Jertih, to serve the jail sentence from today.
However, he said the court took into consideration that Rosdi had been
in prison for six months during remand for the offence, since July 16,
2003, and will therefore be required to serve only 10 years in jail
effective today and six strokes of the rotan.
Rosdi, who was seen crying when Zainal Azman ordered the sentence, was
charged with raping the girl, at 6pm on July 3, 2003 at Taman Desa Ehsan,
Kampung Padang Luas, Jertih.
Earlier, before handing down the sentence, Zainal Azman said the
defence had failed to raise any reasonable doubt on the prosecution case.
He said although Rosdi testified that the victim was his girlfriend and
no element of force was involved, it was still an offence for him to have
sex with her because she was underage.
""The accused had intercourse with the victim on several occasions,
including in the mosque toilet, which showed that he intentionally took
advantage of the girl on the excuse that they were lovers,"" he added.
In mitigation, Rosdi, who was represented by lawyer Zameri Nawang, said
his client had to support an ageing mother who relied on assistance from
the Welfare Department.
He also said that Rosdi was remorseful and vowed not to commit the
offence again.
Deputy Public Prosecutor Ahmad Kamal Arifin Ismail appeared for the

"BOYS ARE MORE AT RISK THAN GIRLS IN SEXUAL ABUSE
Children-Abuse
KUALA LUMPUR, June 1 (Bernama) -- In child sexual abuse cases, girls
are normally perceived as victims but a survey in the United States found
otherwise.
Lois Engelbrecht, a consultant on children affairs, said boys were more
at risk compared to girls as victims of sexual abuse.
""It is our cultural norm to be less protective of male children, thus
leaving the boys with higher risk of being victims of sexual abuse,"" she
said at the Bar Council Legal Aid Centre's Sexual Abuse workshop here
today.
She said this was the finding of a survey conducted among children in
the United States.
According to her, most of the cases go unreported.
In actuality, boys were more at risk as compared to girls since most of
the sexual offenders were men and boys were taken for granted as safe when
they are around their own gender, she said.
""Many children tell their parents but most parents don't listen or most
parents don't believe and they say never mind, especially if it's a
boy...children have to tell 8 times before someone believes them,"" she
said.
Out of 10 boys molested, one became an offender, she said.
Engelbrecht, who herself is a victim and survivor of child sexual
abuse, urged the society to rethink about the culture and norm which in a
way supported sexual offenders.
""But how we educate the children. How we teach them values, norms,
interpersonal relationships, especially what is good and what is bad touch,
and we don't even teach our children private parts.
""If we don't teach them about private parts, we can't teach them rules
about private parts,"" said Engelbrecht, the trainer of a project dubbed the
""P.S. Children Project In Malaysia"",
Commenting on punishment, she said the survey revealed that children
are more willing to talk when they know that severe penalty would not be
imposed on offenders who are normally those they loved.
Instead of concentrating on severe punishment, consultation and
rehabilitation should be given to the offenders, she said.
""We have to create a safe world for these children. We don't have a
safe world right now,"" she said.

Committee, was attended by legal officers, social workers and police

SUNGAI PETANI, Oct 1 (Bernama) -- Police sprang a surprise today by
announcing the arrest of a second suspect in the brutal rape-murder of
primary three schoolgirl Siti Syazwani Ahmad Dusukhi nearly two years ago
that shocked the nation.
The 37-year-old suspect, a man believed to be mentally unsound and a
neighbour of the dead girl in Taman Rhu, Tikam Batu, near here, was
arrested at about 2.30am on Sept 20, said Kedah police chief Datuk Zuber
Shariff.
He told a news conference today that the unemployed man would be
charged with murder in the Sungai Petani magistrate's court tomorrow under
Section 302 of the Penal Code.
Zuber did not give details of the police investigation or the arrest
but denied the police were under pressure by ""higher-ups"" to solve the
crime.
""The police never closed the file on this case, especially since there
is much public interest in it, but the investigation took time,"" he said.
Siti Syazwani, 9, was found dead in a ditch in an oil palm plantation
about 100 metres from her house at 9.15am on Dec 22, 2004.
She had been raped, strangled and battered on the head with a hard
object.
A day after the discovery of the body, police arrested and charged a
25-year-old Indonesian labourer with the crime, but the court freed him
because there was no concrete evidence against him although he made a
confession.
The father of the girl, Ahmad Dusukhi Mohd Noor, 53, an ex-serviceman
who is now a lorry driver, met Prime Minister Datuk Seri Abdullah Ahmad
Badawi in Kepala Batas, Penang last Aug 13 to appeal to him to help find
the killer of his daughter.
Two weeks after that meeting, Ahmad Dusukhi received a letter from the

IGP-PROBE
KUALA LUMPUR, April 2 (Bernama) -- While two policemen are under probe for
allegedly raping and robbing a China national early yesterday, the police
suspect the victim could be involved in a prostitution syndicate.
Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Musa Hassan said among others, the
police would investigate whether the 42-year-old woman was brought into the
country by the syndicate for vice activities.
He said he had received information that the woman was a China national who
was linked to illegal activities.
""The two policemen would be subjected to fair and detailed investigations
for the alleged crimes.
""More often than not, we have spoken of (policemen displaying) a sense of
integrity and carrying out their duties to the best of their ability.
""If our investigations reveal that the policemen were guilty of the crime,
they would face disciplinary action and the full wrath of the law,"" added Musa.
He was speaking to reporters after attending a blood donation drive in
conjunction with the 201st Police Day celebrations at the Police Training
Centre here today.
Early yesterday, the 28-year-old police constable and a 40-year-old lance
corporal attached to the Dang Wangi police headquarters were detained following
a police report, alleging they had taken turns to rape the China national and
even robbed her of her cash and valuables.
It is understood the victim, from Hunan, China, accompanied by a
compatriot, was waiting outside a budget hotel in Jalan Pudu about 3am, while a
police team conducted investigations into the death plunge of another
compatriot from the building.
At that juncture, a police patrol car arrived before the victim was bundled
into the vehicle and taken to a secluded area where the policemen allegedly
took turns to rape her. The woman also claimed she was robbed.
Asked if he was saddened over the allegations against the two policemen,
especially since the force had raised its image with a new motto, 'Firm, Fair
and Courteous' the IGP said:
""What is there to be sad...if people do not want to listen, stern action
has to be taken.""
Meanwhile, city police chief, Datuk Muhammad Sabtu Othman said that
according to a medical report from Hospital Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia
(HUKM), no injury or semen stains were found on the victim's private part.
He said police investigations also revealed that the woman's handphone was

"WOMAN CLAIMS MAN USED BLACK MAGIC TO RAPE HER
Police-Rape
PETALING JAYA, March 3 (Bernama) -- A 31-year-old woman lodged a police
report yesterday claiming that she was hypnotised and raped on several
occasions by a man who had befriended her in October last year.
Deputy OCPD Supt Abdul Rahman Ibrahim said the woman, a clerk at a
laboratory here, said she believed the suspect had used black magic to keep
her in a trance when he raped her.
She had gone to the Petaling Jaya police station at 2.20 am to lodge
the report.
Abdul Rahman said the suspect, in his 30s, had exchanged telephone
numbers with the woman and had asked her out afterwards.
The woman, who is unmarried, claimed that she was first raped by the
suspect in a chalet in Port Dickson last year. He had taken her there after
giving her a spiked drink.
Abdul Rahman said the woman claimed the suspect hypnotised and raped
her numerous times at his rented house in Taman Gembira, Jalan Kuchai Lama,
and at her house in Taman Medan.
She said that though she realised she had been raped, she was afraid to
go to the police as the suspect had threatened to manipulate the matter to
humiliate her and her family.
The woman said her brother-in-law who came to her house recently to fix
the ceiling fan discovered white dust on the fan blades and a piece of
yellow cloth tied to the fan, materials they associated with the practice
of black magic. The fan was then cleaned and the cloth discarded in a
river.
The woman claimed she was last raped by the suspect at his house on Feb
14 at about 2 pm.

"FORGETTING RAPE IS NEVER POSSIBLE
Feature-Rape
KUALA LUMPUR, May 3 (Bernama) - Pain is always one emotion people try
not to think if they can have their way. But often times, in reality some
'pain' is there to stay forever.
Trying to put the pain behind is what college student Beena (not her
real name) intends to do. A rape survivor, this teenager wants to put the
ordeal behind and get on with life.
Beena, 19, was molested and later raped 10 times on different occasions
by a man whom she had befriended. Yet, she lodged no police report nor
informed anyone of what happened.
CONFUSION AND FEAR
Beena's nightmare did not stop there. The man also sent her lewd
messages on her mobile phone calling her names like whore etc.
Beena who shared her nightmare with Bernama recently on condition of
anonymity said she was terrified to speak even a word of the incident to
her mother and grandmother.
""I love them a lot and am scared of losing them. I do not know what to
do. I did a pregnancy test and was relieved when the results were negative.
I want to continue with my studies and start my own life. It does sometimes
bother me that I did not seek help. But then I try and not think about what
happened and want to put it behind,"" she added.
""All has been quiet for now. The man is getting married in July. For me
I hope I can forget what happened,"" she said.
But can she really forget what had happened?
RAPE CANNOT BE 'FORGOTTEN'
A rape survivor will never forget her ordeal, says independent
consultant psychologist Valerie Jaques.
Jaques said what could change is the survivor's emotional response to
the incident.
""Many who recall the incident will feel the same emotions that they
felt during the ordeal. As they grow older and if they are trying to hide
or run away from the fact, then these emotions will get worse. This can
result in flashbacks and nightmares that cause high anxiety, panic attacks
and push the person into depression. The longer the emotions and experience
are hidden, the more drastic the emotional and psychological expression
when it is uncovered,"" she said.
Jaques explained the sooner the experiences were brought to light
through awareness exercises, the more the survivor was able to focus on the
memory as a thought without the emotions attached.
""Eventually it will not be harmful again,"" she said.
SUPPORT VITAL
Jaques said the psychological scar faced by a rape survivor depended on
the support available.
""If there is a lot of family support, care and encouragement in
realising that rape is a crime against the person and that this person is
not socially looked down upon then there is little scarring. In fact this
person can rise up to champion the causes,"" she added.
However, if the survivor comes from an environment where she is blamed
for the rape and put down and rejected, the psychological damage due to the
rejection and lack of support causes 'scar' for a long time.
""Often the wound re-opens whenever the survivor is faced with
challenges that invokes emotional responses. It is imperative for any
person who has been through such crisis to get support and feel loved and
accepted in spite of having been raped and her being violated. Sadly, the
society we live in has much to learn here,"" Jaques said.
ANOTHER SURVIVIOR'S ORDEAL
Another rape survivor, who calls herself Amy said seeking support is
very important albeit the worry and fear of being discriminated.
The fear of being ostracised is always there and the victim has to dump
this myth and go out and get the much needed counseling and support, she
pointed out.
Amy was only 11 when a relative raped her. That was 20 years ago.
""I spent my growing up years blaming myself for what happened and it
took me a while to realise I was not at fault. The pain of what happened
will never go away and as much as I wish I can forget it, which is just
wishful thinking. So the best way is to accept what happened and deal with
the pain and get on with life. Healing will be a painful process but we
survivors owe it to ourselves to come out of this painful emotions and move
on,"" she said.
DO NOT BLAME YOURSELF
All Women's Action Society (AWAM) executive director Honey Tan Lay Ean
said the fear of societal stigma surrounding rape survivors including
blaming the victim and the belief that women had a hand in the rape, served
as a powerful motivator in forcing the survivors to keep silent.
""There is great pressure on the survivors not to report the rape
because as police statistics show, more than 80 percent of the perpetrators
are people known to the victim, which means the rapist is no stranger,"" Tan
told Bernama.
She said putting the rape 'behind' was not the same as not taking any
action.
""A survivor can only begin to heal and move forward when she has some
form of support for instance through counseling. Whilst survivors often go
into a state of denial about the rape, the psychological consequences
persist even after years.
""From AWAM's experience, survivors can live a reasonably functional
life but the trauma caused by the rape may be triggered again by any
incident that remotely reminds them of the assault,"" Tan said.
STIGMA AND COMMUNITY'S ROLE
Tan said it was not the rape survivor's duty to provide moral lessons
to the public in handling rape.
She said on the contrary the focus should be on the community's role to
send out a message to the perpetrators that violence will not be tolerated
and to push for legal reforms that would ensure better access to justice
for rape survivors.
""Rape is a crime of violence that uses sex as a weapon and a reflection
of the power imbalance within society. Therefore it is contingent upon the
community to correct this imbalance and to support the survivors instead of
perpetuating myths about rape,"" Tan stressed.

"NURSERY OPERATOR'S HUSBAND GETS 15 YEARS AND 5 STROKES FOR RAPE OF GIRL
Court-Nursery
SHAH ALAM, June 3 (Bernama) -- A mini market supervisor was jailed for
15 years and ordered to be given five strokes of the rotan by the Sessions
Court here today for raping a five-year-old girl who was under the charge
of his wife at her day nursery.
Mohamed Yusof Rahmat, 34, was found guilty of committing the offence at
the day nursery in Taman Greenwood, Gombak, between 8 am and 5 pm on Dec 25
2001 and Jan 14 2002.
Judge Suraya Othman however allowed his application for stay of
execution pending appeal in the High Court.
She increased bail to RM10,000 in one surety from RM5,000 granted to
him previously. The defence was ordered to file the notice of appeal
tomorrow.
On May 21 last year, the girl testified against Mohamed Yusof through
video conferencing.
In passing sentence, Suraya said that the court had taken into account
that it was Mohamed Yusof's first offence.
Suraya however said that the offence committed by Mohamed Yusof, a
father of four, was serious as it involved a child who had been traumatised
by the incident.
She said that as a father, Mohamed Yusof should know that children
should be protected and cared for instead of being subjected to what he
did.
Earlier in her judgment, she said that the girl had unhesitatingly
identified Mohamed Yusof as the person who committed the offence.
She also said that the court had been cautious so as not to convict a
person based on unsworn evidence of a child, who was then already six
years' old.
However, she said, the girl's evidence was corroborated by the evidence
of medical experts and family members.
Deputy Public Prosecutor Sallehuddin Saidin, who proposed that a heavy
sentence be imposed on Mohamed Yusof, said that it should serve as a
deterrence to others as rape cases were now rampant.
He also said that the fact that the child was entrusted by her parents
and her grandparents to be taken care of at the nursery must also be taken
into consideration.
Defence counsel Mohamed Hanipa Maidin, in mitigation, said that a heavy
sentence would not help solve the problem of rampant rape cases in the
country.

A police spokesman said Tan Lai Meng, 20, who had been a student at the

"ACCUSED TESTIFIES THAT ALLEGED RAPE VICTIM CAUGHT UP IN IMAGINARY WORLD
RAPE-TEACHER
KOTA KINABALU, Nov 3 (Bernama) -- A man, facing two counts of rape involving
a
minor from Singapore, claimed the alleged victim was caught up in an imaginary
world which included sex.
Adrian Simon, 31, testifying as the first defence witness at his trial which
commenced before Sessions Court judge Duncan Sikodol, said the 11-year-old
alleged victim, then his student in Primary Six, liked to fantasise.
""She had a book in which she wrote about her imaginary friends and among
others, having ""sex on the roof "" with her imaginary friend named ""Bob"".
He said he came to know of this from the alleged victim's boyfriend (and
classmate) who showed the book to him. He said he had chided the alleged victim
and advised her to throw it away.
Adrian was a mathematics and science teacher at SRS Datuk Simon Fung before
he was asked to resign over the incidents, allegedly committed inside the
school's science laboratory storeroom between February and March this year,
between 2.10pm and 3.30pm and 10.25am, respectively.
He allegedly committed the first offence while giving tuition in the
subjects to the alleged victim, and the second offence, during recess.
Cross-examined by Deputy Public Prosecutor Luke Ressa Balang, he
categorically
denied that he had sex with the alleged victim.
Defended by counsel Hairul V. Othman, Adrian also dismissed the
prosecution's contention that it was impossible for an 11-year-old to relate an
imagined episode in court explicitly.
""Nowadays, children are exposed to the new media. Even in the computer room,
they know how to search for pornography. Some of the pupils even talked about
sex as if it were a normal thing,"" he testified.
Meanwhile, second defence witness Felix Wong Tsern How, 36, an electrical
engineer, told the court that he had known the accused for 12 years.
""We are actively involved in church activities. He is helpful, supportive,
respectful, honourable, generous...""
Cross-examined by Luke, he said even if his own son or daughter were to
tell him that the accused had done such a thing to them, he would rather believe
Adrian and would not lodge a police report.
However, Carmen Alice Jayasuriya, 36, a teacher and librarian at the school,
turned hostile witness when she testified about the accused's allegedly
inappropriate behaviour.

the accused allowed the female pupils to climb all over him, touch and smack him

"SYNDICATE FORCING INDON WOMEN INTO PROSTITUTION
Police-Prostitutes
IPOH, May 4 (Bernama) -- Perak police have detected a syndicate which
forced Indonesian women into prostitution after bringing them into the
country to work as housemaids.
Perak police chief Datuk Syed Abdul Rahman Syed Abdul Kadir said their
activities came to light on April 25 when police raided an entertainment
outlet in Bidor where they found 14 Indonesian women who were brought into
the country via Pontian, Johor by the syndicate operating in Kluang.
Investigations showed they were promised jobs as housemaids with a
lucrative income but were later forced to become prostitutes, he told
reporters after attending the monthly assembly at the Perak police
contingent headquarters.
Syed Abdul Rahman said police statistics on the arrest of prostitutes
in the state in the first four months of this year was worrying as there
was a significant increase with 52 arrests as compared to 43 from February
to December last year.
Twenty-seven of them were Thais, 17 Indonesians, six Chinese and two
Uzbek women, he said, adding that as Perak borders Thailand, it had
facilitated the easy entry and movements of Thai prostitutes in the state.
He said foreign prostitutes entered Malaysia using valid travel
documents and charged between RM120 and RM180 for their services.
Syed Abdul Rahman also said although the crime rate in Perak dropped
slightly last month from the previous month, robbery and rape cases were on
the rise.
He said property crime also dwindled by about 10 per cent as the owners
took extra precaution on their properties.
As at April, police have detained 82 criminals and solved 87 robbery,
murder and rape cases, he said.
Touching on drug cases, police have detained 19 suspected traffickers
under Section 39B of the Dangerous Drugs Act, 25 people under Section 39A

"RUBBER TAPPER'S RAPE CONVICTION, JAIL SENTENCE UPHELD
Court-Rape
PUTRAJAYA, Oct 4 (Bernama) -- The Court of Appeal here today upheld the
conviction and 18 years' jail sentence imposed by a Sessions Court on a
rubber tapper for raping his 12-year-old stepdaughter who gave birth to a
baby boy in June 1995.
President of the Court of Appeal, Datuk Abdul Malek Ahmad, who sat with
Justices Datuk Arifin Zakaria and Tengku Datuk Baharudin Tengku Mahmud,
unanimously dismissed the 62-year-old man's appeal.
Abdul Malek said there was no merit in the argument by defence counsel,
T. Mura Raju, pertaining to the amendment of the charge by the Sessions
Court.
The charge was amended by the court only with regard to the month, he
said, adding that although the amended charge was not read out at the time
the amendment was made, it was read before the man was called to make his
defence.
He said the court was also satisfied that the chemist who testified in
the trial, was a DNA expert based on his forensic chemistry qualification
although he did not specifically say so.
Abdul Malek also said the court was of the view, even without DNA
evidence, that there was other evidence sufficient to convict the man.
On Feb 11, 1998, the Temerloh Sessions Court sentenced the man, then
52, to 18 years' jail after finding him guilty of raping the girl in an
unnumbered house in Kg Ulu Teris Bapong, Padang Tengku, Kuala Lipis,
Pahang, between 12.30am and 2am in September 1994.
The man appealed to the Court of Appeal after the Temerloh High Court
on May 20 1999, dismissed his appeal to set aside the Sessions Court's
decision.
The Court of Appeal is the last avenue of appeal for the man.
The man, who has three wives and 15 children, has already served about
six years and eight months of his sentence.

"PROSTITUTION RING UNCOVERED AFTER WOMAN'S DARING ACT
Police-Prostitutes
KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 5 (Bernama) -- An Indonesian woman made a daring
escape from a prostitution syndicate this morning by climbing out from the
kitchen of a 17th floor apartment unit.
Her daring act enabled police to rescue 14 foreign women who were
locked inside an apartment unit besides arresting three local men who were
believed to be involved in prostitution using the women.
At 10.30 this morning, the victim climbed out of the kitchen window of
the apartment building at Taman Wangsa Permai, Kepong, and sought help by
waving her hands to attract the attention of security guards on the ground.
According to a witness, the apartment building's security guards,
thinking that the woman was attempting suicide, called the police before
rushing to the 17th floor to rescue her.
""After being rescued, the woman cried and said that she had been duped
by a prostitution syndicate who had earlier offered her a job as a helper
at a restaurant,"" the witness told reporters at the scene.
According to the witness, the woman said she had been forced to become
a prostitute and expressed her desire to return to her village in
Indonesia.
A police team from the Gombak Police Headquarters rushed to the unit
where the women were being kept, and asked the occupants inside to open the
door.
However, after waiting for half-an-hour, the police forced open the
iron grill to enter the apartment unit.
Upon examination, police found 14 women comprising Indonesians,
Vietnamese and Thais aged between 17 and 25 inside three rooms in the
apartment.
Three local men aged between 26 and 47 were also detained and later
taken to the Gombak Police Headquarters for further investigation.
Gombak OCPD ACP Mohd Azmir Mohd Nazri, when met at his office, said all
the women detained did not have valid travel documents.
He said they were believed to be involved in a prostitution ring and
police were still conducting further investigation to determine how long
the syndicate had been operating in the premises.

"PM TO MEET VARIOUS PARTIES OVER RAPE ISSUE
Shahrizat-Rape
KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 5 (Bernama) -- Datuk Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi would
attend a meeting with various parties next month to discuss crimes of
violence against women particularly rape, said Women and Family Development
Minister Datuk Seri Shahrizat Abdul Jalil.
She said the Prime Minister had agreed to meet representatives of
several ministries, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), Wanita Umno and
related agencies to discuss the issue.
Minister in the Prime Minister's Department Datuk Seri Dr Rais Yatim,
Attorney-General Tan Sri Abdul Gani Patail and Wanita Umno chief Datuk Seri
Rafidah Aziz are among those expected to attend the discussion.
Shahrizat told reporters this after opening the ""Stop Rape: Respect and
Restraint"" consultative forum here today.
The forum was attended by some 800 participants from various government
agencies, NGOs and universities.
Shahrizat said resolutions at today's forum would be merged with that
adopted at another consultative forum to be held by the ministry on Feb 18
before a memorandum was drawn out and submitted to the Cabinet.
""Those with any suggestion or idea can submit it at the next forum.
""They can do it between 2pm and 4pm while from 4pm to 6pm we will
discuss the legal issues including the call to flog (rapists) in public and
castration,"" she said.
Shahrizat said participation of people from all walks of life was
crucial towards ensuring effectiveness in government efforts to deal with
such crimes.
""These are not the tasks of women alone, the men should also be more
active as the crimes are committed by those from this gender,"" she said.
Earlier in her speech, Shahrizat said violence against women was
believed to have originated from traditions and social structure which
placed men as the family head and decision-maker who have the economic and
social authority.
""However studies show that the root cause is the imbalance in relations
between the men and women,"" she said.
The violations occurred when the offenders felt they had control over
their victims, she said.
Shahrizat said police statistics showed that rape cases in Malaysia
steadily went up from 1,217 in 2000 to 1,386 cases in 2001, 1,431 (2002)
and 1,479 last year.
""Most of the victims are below 15 years old. Statistics for 2003 showed
about 52 per cent of the victims are below the age of 15,"" she said.
She said the 2003 statistics showed 93 per cent of the rape offenders
or suspected offenders were above 18 years old.
""The 2003 figures also show that 16.6 per cent of the suspects are
known to the victims, 42.1 per cent are acquaintances or newly-found
friends while 20 per cent are boyfriends or fiances and the rest being
their own father, stepfather, uncle, neighbours and others,"" she said.

"LAW CHANGES ON RAPE DEFINITION TO BE DEBATED DESPITE OBJECTIONS
Radzi-Amendments
KUALA LUMPUR, July 5 (Bernama) -- Amendments on the definition of rape
in two laws will be tabled in the Dewan Rakyat despite objections by
non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and the Bar Council, said Home
Affairs Minister Datuk Seri Radzi Sheikh Ahmad.
The bills to amend the Penal Code and Criminal Procedure Code will be
tabled for debate next week.
""There are no changes to the bills,"" he told reporters in Parliament
today.
The Bar Council objects to a provision that makes a male superior
liable to be charged with rape for having sex with a subordinate staff even
if the victim gives her consent.
It said the definition could lead to innocent men being victimised and
accused of rape.
Muslim organisations also objected to a provision on ""marital rape"",
saying that it was inconsistent with the syariah.
Radzi said the proposed amendments would not disadvantage anyone
because each allegation of rape had to be investigated.
He said the authorities would not simply take action against an
employer just because an employee alleged she had been raped.
""If the couple are found to be lovers and the woman makes a report of
rape after they break off, surely the authorities will not charge her
partner.
""However, if a new woman employee is pressured into having sex with a
superior, that is a different story,"" he said.
He said the amendments should be viewed positively and as a warning to
employers not to take advantage of their staff.

"USTAZ'S RAPE APPEAL: JUDGE RECUSES HIMSELF
Court-Ustaz
PUTRAJAYA, July 5 (Bernama) -- The Court of Appeal here today adjourned
the hearing of the public prosecutor's appeal against the acquittal of an
ustaz on a rape charge after one of the judges recused himself.
Justice Datuk Gopal Sri Ram agreed to recuse himself following an
application by Ram Karpal Singh, counsel for the religious teacher, Ishak
Shaari.
Ram Karpal Singh made the application on the ground that Sri Ram had
heard and dismissed Ishak's appeal against conviction on another charge of
outraging the modesty of the same girl and had made adverse comments
against his client in that case.
""Because of that, his mind may be affected in this appeal,"" said Ram
Karpal Singh.
Sri Ram, presiding with Court of Appeal judges Datuk Wira Ghazali
Mohamed Yusoff and Datuk James Foong Cheng Yuen, agreed with the counsel
and adjourned the case to a date to be fixed.
On Feb 23 2000, Ishak, 42, was sentenced to 15 year's jail and five
strokes of the rotan by the Seremban Sessions for raping a Form Two girl at
the counselling room of Sekolah Menengah Taman Indah, Tampin, at 12.30pm on
July 4 1995.
The High Court allowed his appeal and acquitted him after ruling that
there was a misdirection on the standard of proof of the case and there
were no seminal stains on the bedsheet.
Today's appeal is against that decision.
In the molest case, Ishak was sentenced to four years jail and two
strokes of the rotan by the Magistrate's court for outraging the girl's
modesty at a house in Taman Sebang Baru, Pulau Sebang, Alor Gajah, Melaka,
at 2pm on June 28, 1995 but the High Court reduced the sentence to two
years with no whipping.

Hishammuddin-Rape
KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 5 (Bernama) -- The Education Ministry does not
propose to introduce a special subject in schools to help tackle the
problem of rape, Minister Datuk Hishammuddin Tun Hussein said today.
The ministry was open to any suggestions to curb rape as long as they
did not involve the introduction of a special subject.
""There is no real necessity to have a special subject, but it (rape) is
a serious problem and I am not taking it lightly. It is something that has
been taken onboard our education system from the start,"" he told reporters
after chairing the ministry's post cabinet meeting here.
Yesterday, the Women, Family and Community Development Ministry
announced that it would be implementing an integrated approach with six
ministries and other departments, including the Education Ministry, to curb
sexual crimes, especially rape.
The ministries and other departments involved were the Housing and
Local Government, Internal Security and Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs
ministries, the Attorney General's Chambers and the National Unity and
National Integration Department.
Hishammuddin said the existing subjects like Islamic Studies and Moral
Studies and Civics were sufficient to educate the students on the crime.
He also said that the spirit of patriotism was important to create
awareness among the society on the country's independence and unity.
""I am touched because the opposition leaders also called for the
setting aside of each others' narrow-mindedness to remind the young
generation of the meaning of independence and the Education Ministry is
also not exempted,"" he said.
He said the School Division with the cooperation of the State Education
Department had planned two main programmes, namely the Student Leaders'
Patriotic Assembly and the Royal Trophy Elocution, in conjunction with the

The assembly at the Melaka International Trade Centre (MITC) from Aug

only raped a girl who was mentally slow but had also invited his friend to

Akok, 22, was found guilty of committing the offence in a house in

The offence under section 376 of the Penal Code carries a maximum 20

In mitigation, counsel H.C. Tan, for Akok, asked for leniency, saying
that his client was still young, not married and had to support his aged
parents.
However, deputy public prosecutor S. Devanandan said Akok should be

the term rape,"" he told reporters after opening the 30th general assembly
of Malaysian Ex-Policemen's Association, here today.
He was asked on the latest development on the rape issue following
several suggestions including castration which had been made to curb the
crime.
Asked whether the review would broaden the definition of rape Rais said
it might include other heineous acts such as the using of objects as a
raping tool.
Asked whether the new definition would be included along with the
amendment to the CPC, expected to be passed by the Parliament during its
March sitting, Rais said they would try.
""But I must caution the media that all these must be subjected to
technical, specific and thorough study. It cannot be done as a knee-jerk
reaction,"" he said.
Earlier in his speech, Rais called on the non-governmental
organisations (NGOs) especially the Malaysian Ex-Policemen's Association to
support the police force in curbing rape and petty crimes.
He said with 85,000 members, the association could play a vital role by
collaborating with the police and Rukun Tetangga to form a monitoring team
in their neighbourhood to prevent such crimes.

Police-Rape
PETALING JAYA, May 7 (Bernama) -- Police detained another three
suspects in connection with the gang rape of a Universiti Teknologi Mara
(UiTM) student on Tuesday night.
Petaling Jaya OCPD Datuk Ghazali Md Amin said the three men were
detained around Puchong and would be remanded until Thursday following a
court order to this effect.
""With this, the number of suspects detained in connection with the case
has increased to 10,"" he told reporters at his office here today.
Earlier seven suspects were detained in a special operation around
Puchong at 10pm last Wednesday following a report made by the victim at
around 5am on the same day.
He said all the suspects were aged between 17 and 25 and most of them
were factory workers while others were unemployed.
Narrating the incident Ghazali said after finishing her part-time job
at a complex in Shah Alam the victim went out with a man known to her just
for a month through the Internet chat room and telephone conversation. The
university student only knew the man by his pen name.
""Later the girl agreed to go with him on a motorcycle for a drink. The
man then took the victim to a double-storey house in Puchong allegedly to

"STATUTORY RAPE CASES ON THE RISE IN SINGAPORE
SINGAPORE-RAPE
SINGAPORE, Feb 8 (Bernama) -- Statutory rape cases in Singapore involving
girls under 14 years, rose 36.1 per cent from 61 cases in 2008 to 83 last year.
The city-state police said as in previous years, the girls had consensual
sex with their boyfriends, friends and acquaintances who formed the bulk of the
culprits in such cases.
In its 2009 annual crime brief today, the police said they would continue to
work closely with the education, culture, youth and sports ministries and the
National Crime Prevention Council to enhance crime awareness talks to address
the growing trend of teenage sex.
It said all stakeholders, including the community, schools, parents and the
media had an important role to play in educating youth against under-age sex.
The police also said the overall crime situation in Singapore remained under
control for 2009, with the number of overall crime cases decreasing by 0.4
per cent to 32,968 cases from 33,113 cases in 2008.
The police were also concerned with the increase in petty theft cases which
rose from 19,918 in 2008 to 20,402 last year, and break-ins at Housing
Development Board residences, education and care centres that jumped from a
record low of 898 cases in 2008 to 1,026 last year.
They said, four other crime classes showed a slight dip in the number of
cases reported last year, namely crimes against persons such as murder and
rioting (4,370 cases), violent property crimes, particularly robbery (749
cases), commercial crimes (3,357 cases) and miscellaneous crimes which included

"CAN THE LAW CURB RAPE CASES?
Rape
KUALA LUMPUR: ""You have been found guilty. Therefore, the court
sentences you to 19 years' imprisonment and 12 strokes of the rotan for
raping your daughter who was 15 years old then.""
Kota Baharu Sessions Court judge Mohamad Yazid Mustafa made the
decision on Feb 8 after a 43-year-old ex-soldier was found guilty of raping
his own daughter at his house in Tanah Merah, Kelantan, at about 4am on Dec
25, 2001.
Mohamad Yazid said, as a father, the accused should protect his
daughter and not take advantage by raping her after fetching the girl home
from an elderly relative's house.
Is such punishment enough to deter rapists from committing the
condemned act? Or, should severe penalties, such as the death sentence,
life imprisonment or public caning be considered to curb the crime?
Whatever it is, rape and murder have been on the rise of late and
parents are worried about letting their daughters out or to stay at home
alone.
ARE THE AMENDED PENALTIES SUFFICIENT?
Solicitor General Datuk Zaiton Zawiah Puteh said prior to Aug 1, 2002,
the charge of rape under Section 375 of the Penal Code did not specify
cases involving family members or incest.
She said the maximum punishment for rape is 20 years' jail and minimum
is five years, and caning may also be meted out but it is not mandatory.
After Aug 1, 2002, the Penal Code was amended to introduced new
provisions -- Section 376A and Section 376B.
Section 376A defines ""incest"" as sexual intercourse with another person
whose relationship to him or her is such that he or she is not permitted,
under the law, religion, custom or usage applicable to him or her, to marry
that other person.
Section 376B provides the punishment -- a minimum of six years' jail,
up to 20 years and liable to caning.
Later, Act A1210 amended the Penal Code to include a penalty of not
more than 30 years' jail and not less than 15 years as well as mandatory
caning of not less than 10 strokes if whoever commits rape on a woman whose
relationship to him is such that he is not permitted under the law,
religion, custom or usage, to marry her.
It also provides the death penalty for whoever causes death while
committing rape or attempting to do so.
Zaiton is of the opinion that prevention is much more vital in curbing
rape and murder, but must be balanced with suitable punishment.
She feels that existing laws on rape are sufficient.
ENFORCEMENT OF THE LAWS
Meanwhile, several quarters feel that imposing the heavier punishment
is important to curb such crime.
Malaysian Parents Consensus Council president Prof Madya Mohamad Ali
Hasan suggests immediate amendment be made to existing laws by taking into
account the appropriate punishment to match the crime as it will also serve
as a ""scare and deterrent"" in keeping with the Islamic religion.
He recommends that a convicted rapist who caused death to the victim be
caned publicly and given the mandatory death sentence while those guilty of
similar offence but not causing death be sentenced to life imprisonment and
given the rotan.
""It is time for public stoning and caning to be implemented to make the
public, particularly Muslims, realise that such punishment has been used
for ages and Muslims should not dispute it,"" he said.
Agreeing with Mohamad Ali's proposal is Mufti for the Federal Territory
Prof Dr Mohammed Yusoff Hussin who is of the opinion that such punishment
would educate society against committing such crime.
""If society feels that public caning will cause embarrassment to the
family of the offender, that it is cruel and against human rights, why must
we be more concerned about the rapist and not the victim?"" he asked.
""How do you think the family of the victim would feel... don't they too
suffer from embarrassment throughout the life. Whoever has committed the
crime must face the consequences,"" he added.
Dr Mohammed Yusoff, however, is against castration, mainly due to
humanity.
""Just maximise the existing punishment and that will be enough,"" he
said.
FITTING PUNISHMENT
Mohammed Yusoff also suggests that rapist be given fitting punishment
based on the provisions and if the crime involves death then it must be
punishable with death.
""This punishment must be adhered to by all, no matter what faiths they
are and should not be disputed if society wants to see this cruel crime is
curbed,"" he stressed.
Meanwhile, Federal Territory Women Lawyers' Association deputy
president Yasmin Shariff disagrees on the implementation of public caning
as she feels that counselling the rapist will be the best solution to
address the problem.
She is also of the opinion that education on family health should begin
at primary school with the purpose of, among other things, exposing the
children to knowledge on the human physiology, potential risks and the need
to report when something happens to them.
Religious independent lecturer Ridhuan Tee Abdullah, on the other hand,
said that parents play an important role in moulding and educating children
with good morals and behaviour from young.
Based on his experience through dialogues with the police, the root
cause for rape is that they mix freely, he said.
""If children are allowed to mix freely to the extent that boys and
girls stay in the same room, unwarranted incidents can certainly occur. No
religion allows its followers to socialise freely or to commit sin.
""Go back to your own religion and God willing, rape can be curbed,"" he
said.
IMPORTANCE TO CHECK BEHAVIOUR
Dr Mohammed Yusoff agrees. He said: ""If we want to prevent rape,
parents must make an effort to teach and check the behaviour of their
children, such as to stop their daughter from wearing revealing clothes as
this is one factor that leads to rape and if this occurs then we can say
that it is fated to happen.""
He also mentioned that in the old days, when a father or grandfather
were to enter a child's room, it was to tell tales or legends purely for
education purposes.
""But now, if a father or grandfather were to enter his daughter's or
granddaughter's room, we have to question because they might want to
satisfy their lust,"" he said.
Statistics from the Royal Malaysian Police (PDRM) show a rise in the
number of rape cases. The were 1,217 cases in 2000, 1,386 in 2001, 1,431
cases in 2003 and 1,479 in 2003. On average, the number of rape cases
increased at about 5 percent in the period between 2000 and 2003.
CAUSES OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE
Women, Family and Community Development Minister Datuk Seri Shahrizat
Abdul Jalil said that violence against women stems from tradition, social
structure and values that put men as head of the family and decision maker
as well as having the power to dictate the economic and social aspects.
Citing research conducted by commonwealth bodies, she said the basic
cause of the problem is the imbalance of power between women and men.
The patriachy system and the notion that men are the champions are
traditions that are deeply embedded in our society and, hence, difficult to
erase, said Shahrizat.
She said that among the mental disorders experienced by victims of
sexual violence are fear, low self-esteem, lack of appetite and the feeling
that they have lost their dignity and frowned upon by the society.
Under her ministry, an OMBAK Volunteers Training Programme has been
established as a follow-up to the OMBAK campaign launched by former Prime
Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad on July 23, 2001. There are now 1,857
OMBAK volunteers throughout the country.
Shahrizat said to educate the public on this problem, the ministry is
also organising development seminars on gender perspectives, touching on
issues of violence against women, campaigns through the electronic media
and taking the necessary action based on one's capabilities.

"EARLY SEX EDUCATION KEY TO PREVENTING SEXUAL ABUSE
Sex-Education
KUCHING, May 8 (Bernama) -- Children of school-going age should be
exposed to sex education to eradicate sexual abuse, which has reached
epidemic proportions in Malaysia, according to a university lecturer.
Gill Raja of Universiti Malaysia Sarawak (Unimas) said sex education
should be introduced in the education system to students as early as
possible based on age suitability.
""This is an early exposure step to address problems of sexual abuse
prevalent among girls, aged between 12 and 16,"" she told Bernama after a
one-day seminar on ""Facing the Challenges of Incest"" here today.
She said a Welfare Services Department report stated that 400 to 600
girls, aged 12 to 16, were victims of sexual abuse last year.
""As for girls under the age of 12, 260 of them were victims,"" she said.
Raja, who has been involved in social work for 20 years, however,
cautioned that sexual educators needed to be trained professionals to
effectively manage such classes.
""Otherwise, they will be providing the wrong information resulting in
negative effects on the students,"" she said.
On the issue of incest, Raja called on society not to shun victims and
instead, to listen to their problems as well as to offer them support and
guidance.
""Never look down on the victims as it will devastate them
psychologically and lead to untoward incidents such as suicide,"" she said.

PUTRAJAYA, Aug 8 (Bernama) -- A bus driver who was found guilty by the
High Court for raping his underage daughter, was released today when the
Court of Appeal quashed the conviction and set aside the sentence.
Court of Appeal Judge Datuk Gopal Sri Ram, who presided together with
Justices Datuk Zulkefli Ahmad Makinudin and Datuk Suriyadi Halim Omar, said
the court unanimously allowed the appeal brought by the 51-year-old bus
driver against his conviction and sentence imposed by the Penang High

The father of four children was charged with raping his daughter, who
was 14 years old at the time of the incident, at his house, in Taman
Sepadan, Nibong Tebal, Penang, between 1995 to April 1998.
On Feb 28 2003, the Penang Sessions Court acquitted and discharged him
from the charge of raping his daughter.
However, on Feb 25 2004, the Penang High Court reversed the judgment of
the Sessions Court, and convicted and sentenced him to the maximum of 20
years in prison and 15 lashes of the whip.
Earlier, counsel Jagdeep Singh Deo, who represented the bus driver,
submitted that the High Court Judge was wrong in having interfered with the
Sessions Court Judge's decision when he invoked an adverse presumption
against the man for not having called the younger daughter to testify.
Jagdeep also submitted that the prosecution had relied on the medical
evidence as such corroborative evidence.
""It was however held by the Sessions Court Judge that the medical
evidence was inconclusive and unequivocal and as such could not be relied
upon as corroborative evidence,"" he said.
However, Deputy Public Prosecutor Mior Hashimi Abdul Halim submitted
that the victim's aunt in her evidence had said that the victim told her
that the other siblings also saw what the appellant did to the victim.
Mior Hashimi said from the evidence by the victim's aunt, it was clear
that the appellant had raped his own daughter.

"RAPE CASE: AG RESPECTS COURT'S DECISION
AG-Rape
PUTRAJAYA, Sept 8 (Bernama) -- Attorney-General Tan Sri Abdul Gani
Patail said today that he respects the Court of Appeal's decision to acquit
a janitor of rape on the grounds that the charges preferred against him
breached several sections of the Criminal Procedure Code including the
preferment of very vague charges.
He said the Chambers had to abide and follow the court's decision.
""The only thing...I have really to look at it, since the indication of
""The prosecution's duty is to look at it seriously and properly and
make sure our prosecution goes well,"" he said when asked by reporters to
elaborate on his remarks pertaining to the case as reported in The Star
daily today.
On Monday, the Court of Appeal set aside the conviction and 18-year
jail sentence and eight strokes of the rotan imposed on the 45-year-old man
by the Temerloh Sessions Court after finding him guilty of four counts of
raping his 15-year-old daughter.
Abdul Gani was quoted by the daily as saying many rape cases would have
to be withdrawn from trial following the landmark Court of Appeal judgment
stating that dates of such offences in the charge sheets must be specific.
He was also quoted as saying that following the judgment, the A-G
Chambers had no choice but to withdraw all rape cases with vague dates.
When asked by reporters, Abdul Gani said his remarks in the article
published by the newspaper did not mean that he had criticised the judge.
""To be fair, I have not even read the judgment. If date is the essence,
then I have to look into it.
""We are not here to argue with the court. We are not blaming anybody
because this is important. If the law determines that the date is
important, we have to abide, we have to follow,"" he reiterated.
The three-man bench presided by Justice Datuk Gopal Sri Ram, sitting
with Justices Datuk Hashim Yusoff and Datuk Tengku Baharudin Shah Tengku
Mahmud, found the man's conviction ""highly insecure"" due to the
circumstances under which the trial was conducted at the Sessions Court in
1998.
The man, who spent seven years in jail, was said to have raped the girl
in an oil palm plantation along the Mentakab-Temerloh highway at 2.30 pm in
early December 1996.
Meanwhile, MCA Wanita chief Datuk Dr Ng Yen Yen said that women
non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in the country should express concern
over the landmark judgment.
She said one had to consider the possibility of rape victims not
remembering exactly when they were subjected to the crime due to extreme
psychological distress and trauma.
""If the crime happened, say, one year or even six months ago, it is not
easy. You do not write it in the diary. Even ourselves, if we do not write
it in the diary, we cannot remember what happened two months ago.
""And psychologically speaking, you tend to suppress things you don't
want to remember, things you hate about. Sometimes there is a lapse of
memory,"" she said when commenting on Abdul Gani's remarks over the case.
Dr Ng, who is Deputy Finance Minister, spoke to reporters after
launching the ""Customs Golden Client"" scheme aimed at facilitating further
import and export activities, here.
She said that she had asked the movement's Legal Bureau to study the
matter before taking further action.
""I think consideration should be given to all other angles as well...we

"SEXUAL ABUSE A PROBLEM IN SPORTS, SAYS PSYCHOLOGIST
Sport-Abuse
MELBOURNE, March 9 (Bernama) -- A culture of emotional bullying and
manipulation is leading to sexual abuse at the elite level of sports in
Australia, according to a senior psychologist at the Australian Sports
Commission in Canberra.
Trisha Leahy, who recently completed a major study into the prevalence
and impact of sexual abuse in the lives of athletes, was disturbed to
discover a relatively high number of young men and women being abused from
within their sport.
Leahy undertook a study of 370 athletes, half representing club sports
and the other half representing their sport at an international level.
While she found the overall statistics of sexual abuse similar to other
community samples, she was concerned that 30 per cent of the 185 `elite'
athletes she interviewed had been abused, with 46 per cent of those
claiming that abuse occurred from officials or coaches within their sport.
But Leahy did not find the results totally surprising as she believed
sport often created an environment where ""predators"" could thrive.
""I found one of the primary methods that sexual predators use is
intensive emotional abuse and emotional manipulation,"" she said.
""The point of that is to make the victim believe that he or she is
powerless and the perpetrator cannot be challenged.
""We already have a culture in the sporting system that attributes a lot
of power to coaching staff and support staff so the idea of the powerful
perpetrator is already normalised.
""The other thing that makes sport vulnerable is the acceptance of very
high levels of emotionally abusive behaviour on the part of coaches and
support staff.""
Leahy said she found boys were typically abused in their pre-teen
years, with girls more likely to be abused once they start puberty and
sometimes through to adulthood.
""It's a very, very traumatic and very harmful experience for many
people and the effects of it last for many years,"" she said.
In response to the findings the Australian Government has launched a
""zero-tolerance"" strategy in an attempt to stamp out abuse and harassment.
Sports Minister Jackie Kelly had threatened to cut funding to sports
which do not enforce the anti-harassment policy.

"APRIL 12 HEARING OF JAPANESE ENGINEER'S APPEAL AGAINST RAPE
Court-Appeal
PUTRAJAYA, March 9 (Bernama) -- The Court of Appeal here today fixed
April 12 to hear a Japanese engineer's appeal against his conviction and
sentence of eight years jail and three strokes of the rotan for rape.
Chief Justice Tan Sri Ahmad Fairuz Sheikh Abdul Halim, who sat with
justices Datuk Richard Malanjum and Datuk S.Augustine Paul, fixed the date
after allowing defence counsel Munir Abdullah's application for time to
file the appeal petition.
Munir, for Hiroshi Iwabuchi, told the court that he could not file the
petition because he had not received the grounds of judgment.
The records, however, showed that the grounds of judgment were sent to
the Kajang prison two years ago.
Munir said he wrote to the court for the judgment last year but had not
received a reply until now.
Iwabuchi, 46, was sentenced to eight years' jail and 10 strokes of the
rotan by the Sessions Court for raping a woman manager in a room at the
Shangri-La Hotel in Jalan Sultan Ismail, Kuala Lumpur, between 12.01am and
4am on Nov 19, 1999.

"POLICE REWARD MAN WHO SAVED TWO UKM STUDENTS FROM RAPE
Police-Reward
SHAH ALAM, April 9 (Bernama) -- The man whose curiosity and suspicious-
mind helped saved two students of Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) from
an attempted kidnap and rape at Bandar Baru Bangi last April 3 was today
rewarded for his deed.
Ahmad Zainol Abidin, 32, received RM500 and a commendation letter from
Selangor Police Chief Datuk Ismail Omar at a ceremony at the Selangor
Police Contingent headquarters here.
Recalling the incident, Ahmad said he was on his way to a hardware shop
near UKM when he saw a factory bus parked by the roadside near a fishing
pond at Bandar Baru Bangi.
""I saw hands waving at the bus window and all of a sudden an incident
where a computer engineer (Noor Suzaily Mokhtar) was raped in a bus a Bukit
Tinggi, Klang (in 2000), came to mind. That got me to contact the police,""
he said when met by reporters after the ceremony.
Ahmad, who works for a newspaper company as a production worker, said
he had stored the telephone number of the Bandar Baru Bangi station in his
handphone and that enabled him to contact the police immediately.
""I did it as part of my social obligations to help those in need. I did
not expect any reward but I felt proud to be able to do my bit to help save
the girls.
""The rest was up to the police force that responded swiftly and
effectively to my report,"" he added.
In the April 3 incident which happened at about 9.30am, the two
students from UKM's Law Faculty were kidnapped from their campus when they
boarded a bus, which they thought was providing transport service for
students at the campus, only to realise later that they had been hoodwinked
when the driver drove the bus to an area near the fishing pond and
attempted to rape them.
Meanwhile, Ismail, in commending Ahmad, said the two students would
have been raped had it not been for Ahmad's quick-thinking in alerting the
police.
""This is the kind of attitude we want of Malaysians. If there are more
people like Ahmad, more crime cases can be solved,"" he added.
Besides Ahmad, commendation letters were also given to the three
policemen who went to check on the bus and rescued the two girls. They are
Sargeant Zainal Zakaria, Constable Mohd Azman Azmi and Constable Afa Rizul
Azmi.

NEW DELHI, May 9 (Bernama-Uni) - Several non-governmental organisations
(NGOs) from India and Nepal called for inclusion of the issue of
trafficking in women for prostitution on agenda of the next week's SAARC
meeting at Male.
Representatives of the NGOs on the opening day of a two-day meeting on
''prostitution and preventive action' said the option of establishing
bilateral talks with Bangladesh and Nepal could also be deliberated upon at
the SAARC meet.
Representatives of NGOs from Maharashtra, Kerala, Karnataka, Rajasthan,
Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, Haryana and
Himachal Pradesh and also from Nepal are attending the meeting.
It was also suggested that a nodal agency be set up similar to the
narcotics control bureau with regional centres to check trafficking and
interact with Interpol for preventing trafficking across the borders and
booking culprits.
The National Commission for Women should take up the issue with the
government, they said. The NGOs also demanded that rehabilitation,
facilities like shelter homes be set up along the country's borders and
vigilance cells be set up at bus and railway terminals to monitor such
activities and for rescuing women who are being forced out of the country
or into the country for prostitution.
Stressing on curbing child prostitution, Mrs Mohini Giri, chairperson
of the National Commission for Women said the NCW had been trying to get
loans for such women.
''All these would be effective if the women were made acquainted with
these schemes at the grass root level.'' She said.
There were three categories of children who were forced into
prostitution: those forced by parents to adopt it as an economic activity
or due to religious customs, those lured by promises of jobs and the
children of prostitutes who take up the profession. She called for a
national level study on prostitution. -- Bernama-Uni

"POLICE TO FIND A WAY TO ENSURE SPECIFIC DATES IN RAPE CASES
Police-Rape
PENANG, Sept 9 (Bernama) -- Deputy Inspector-General of Police Datuk
Seri Mohamed Sedek Mohamed Ali said today he is confident that the police
will find a way in their investigations into rape cases to ensure the
specific dates of the offences following a landmark Court of Appeal
judgment last Monday.
He said that the police respected the court's decision and would abide
by its ruling that the dates of such offences in the charge sheets must be
specific.
The court found the conviction of a 45-year-old janitor who has served
seven years' jail on four counts of raping his eldest daughter, who was
then 15, highly insecure due to the circumstances under which the trial had
been conducted in the Temerloh Sessions Court in 1998.
The court ruled that there were breaches of several sections of the
Criminal Procedure Code, including the preferment of very vague charges,
and set aside his conviction and 18 years' concurrent jail term and eight
strokes of the rotan imposed by the Sessions Court.
The police would deal with the matter on the directive of
Attorney-General Tan Sri Abdul Gani Patail, he said after launching the
'Fight Crime' campaign organised by The Star Publications (M) Bhd with the
cooperation of the police here.
He said that the Attorney-General's Chambers would study the various
aspects pertaining to the matter.
Abdul Gani, when commenting on the judgment the following day, was
reported to have said that the Attorney-General's Chambers would have to
withdraw many rape cases with vague dates from trial following the landmark
judgment.
Yesterday, Abdul Gani said that the prosecution's duty now was to look
at the matter seriously and properly and make sure the prosecution
proceeded well.
Mohamed Sedek admitted that there had definitely been rape cases
whereby the police could not state specifically the dates of the offences.
""Certainly there have been times when we could not obtain the specific
remember the dates, during times when the victims suffer from trauma and
cannot think clearly,"" he said.
He cited cases of child rape victims who could not remember the time
and date but only that the incident had occurred.
Earlier in his speech, Mohamed Sedek said that development and
population increase would lead to a higher crime rate.
Mohamed Sedek said that according to statistics, the crime rate
increased from 149,042 cases in 2002 to 156,315 cases last year but the
percentage of the cases solved was 46.6 per cent, exceeding the Interpol's
20 per cent level.

reported in the country from January to August were from Selangor.
Home Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Tun Hussein said Perlis had the least

Kok had asked a breakdown of reported rape, incest and sexual harassment
cases received by the police in every state and the number of cases referred to

years and fined a total of RM30,000 by the Sessions Court here today on
three counts of acting as an intermediary for three other Cambodians,
including her 17-year-old sister, for the purpose of prostitution.
Judge Nursinah Adzmi sentenced Somira Pheap, 27, to three years jail
and RM10,000 fine on each charge, the jail terms to run concurrently from
the date of her arrest on Nov 23 last year.
Somira pleaded guilty to acting with three men, one of whom is still at

at No. 2111, Nilam Apartment, Sri Sinar, Segambut, between Aug 18 and

Each offence under section 372 (1)(f) of the Penal Code carries a

Deputy public prosecutor Nor Ariffin Ishak told the court that the
three women managed to escape from the apartment with the help of two

He said Somira brought the women to Malaysia on Aug 18 last year to
help her husband run a business in Kuala Lumpuregr.

"PM'S DEPT WILL CONDUCT SPECIAL STUDY ON RAPE, SAYS DR RAIS
Rais-Rape
KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 10 (Bernama) -- The Prime Minister's Department will
undertake a special study on rape cases in the country, Minister in the
Prime Minister's Department Datuk Seri Dr Rais Yatim said today.
He said the study would be carried out in collaboration with the police
and the Law Faculty of Universiti Teknologi Mara (UiTM).
The study was necessary to gather actual data on rape as the majority
of the cases involved teenagers, he said.
Furthermore, rape cases have become a topical issue now that had
attracted keen public debate and interest, he said.
""The objective of the study, among others, is to determine the root
causes of rape cases and the environmental factors of rapists and the
tendency of policymakers and non-governmental organisations in respect of
the criminality of rape itself,"" he told reporters after opening a national
seminar on ""Juvenile Delinquency from the Islamic Perspective"".
Dr Rais said the study, involving 1,479 rape victim respondents, is
aimed at finding solutions to their predicament besides seeking the
co-operation of the Prisons Department to talk to rapists on the
circumstances that prompt them to commit the heinous crime.
He said the study would also look into existing penalties and the
possibility of imposing other punishments to rapists.
""We have to study all these because our laws were enacted many decades
ago, apart from Section 376(A) of the Penal Code, the rest were done almost
a 100 years ago. So, it's only fair that we consider this,"" he said.
On juvenile delinquency, Dr Rais suggested the national crime index be
announced for public knowledge to serve as a guide.
He said juvenile delinquency was increasingly worrying, especially
among Malay teenagers who have the highest percentage.
According to police statistics, 3,459 juvenile delinquents were Malay
teenagers compared to 831 Chinese and 640 Indians in 2001, he said.
In 2002, 3,624 Malay youths were convicted as juvenile delinquents,
Chinese (681) and Indians (566) while last year saw 1,897 (Malays), 298
(Chinese) and 286 (Indians) being sentenced for similar offences.
Dr Rais said the crime index data should be translated into
rehabilitation programmes to avoid the index to remain merely as data and
not be used for self-improvement and betterment of society.
He said it was also crucial for the state religious authorities to play
a more effective role by going down to the ground to carry out counselling
programmes.
""Their duties do not end by merely reciting Quranic verses and talking
about the life and traditions of Prophet Muhammad. They need to go down to
the ground to play a more meaningful role,"" he added.

Two of the 21 threats were allegedly made while committing the rape
offences and the rest at a Public Bank branch.
Nurmala questioned why the victim, a property agent, agreed to meet Tee

suffered from retinal haemorrhage, injuries which are virtual signs of
child abuse under such circumstances. It was detected by an opthalmoscope
where haemorrhaging spots on the eye were noticed.
From the nature and extent of the injuries, Dr Shyam said it was
impossible that Salina had fallen as stated in the medical history which
was given to her earlier.
""In this particular case, I saw bruises around the left eye and cheek
which was inconsistent with a fall. This sort of injuries is as if the
child had been punched in the eye,"" she said when questioned by Deputy
Public Prosecutor Tun Abdul Majid Tun Hamzah.
In the dock is Patrick Anak Jupong, 32, charged with causing the death
of Salina on March 20 last year between 11am and 1pm at Batu Gong, 17th
mile Kuching-Serian road, Kota Samarahan near here.
Patrick pleaded not guilty to the charge under section 302 of the Penal
Code which carries the death penalty upon conviction.
Dr Shyam said two gynaecology specialists, Dr Lam Wan Wei and Dr Harris
Njoo Suharjono, who examined the victim's vagina had also confirmed that
there had been sexual interference.
Salina was in a state of shock when she was first brought to the
Accident and Emergency Department, she said.
Another witness, Janet, 14, the victim's sister said her brother-in-law
Patrick had come to their house at around 11 am on the day of the alleged
incident.
Cross-examined by assigned counsel Melaka Nisau, she said the accused
had told her he was going to bring Didek, the victim's nickname, to follow
her father to the padi farm.
However upon their return in the afternoon, Janet noticed that Didek's
left eye was blue black even though Patrick informed her the toddler was
""sleeping"" at that time.
When the victim was found to be unconscious, she was taken to the
government clinic in Siburan near here and later to the SGH.
Hearing before Justice Datuk Ian Chin continues tomorrow.

"CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE: VICTIMS OR FRIENDS MUST TAKE CHARGE
Abuse-Awareness
KUALA LUMPUR, May 11 (Bernama) -- The Malaysian Coalition for the
Prevention of Child Sexual Abuse (MCPSA) has decided to introduce a more
aggressive theme for this year's Child Sexual Abuse Awareness Week.
The MCPSA has said awareness was no longer enough to combat the
problem, so they had selected ""Take Charge"" as the 2003 theme instead.
In its fourth year now, the Child Sexual Awareness Week kicked off at
Sekolah Sri Cempaka, Cheras here today with a one-day workshop on ""Personal
Safety"".
MCPSA's Secretariat Director Madeleine Yong said the focus of this
year's campaign was how teenagers could play an important role in assisting
their peers who had been sexually abused.
""The coalition feels that this year we want to start empowering
children empowering teenagers. It's no longer about awareness anymore
because this is not a new subject. They have to get involved. They must
take charge,"" she told Bernama at the workshop.
Participating students said it was high time for them to act on child
sexual abuse rather than just read about it in newspapers.
""If you do not take charge, to take action, to make sure that victims
of sexual abuse are championed and the abuser is put behind bars, then you
have not taken charge yet,"" said Marisha Naz, 14, who is a Form Two student
at the school.
Marisha's classmate, Sarah Chen Tzee Ein, also 14, couldn't agree more.
""I hope to take charge of myself and actually reach out to my other
friends and say, hey look, if you're being sexually abused, you can just
tell me, I'm open about it and we can do something about it,"" she said
confidently.
Other events for the week include a talk on child sexual abuse
awareness for parents of hearing and visually impaired children on May 12,
at the YMCA Building in Brickfields, Kuala Lumpur, from 10am to noon.

"HANAFI ONLY INTENDED TO RAPE AND NOT MURDER SUZAILY, SAYS COUNSEL
Court-Suzaily
PUTRAJAYA, Dec 11 (Bernama) -- Former express bus driver Hanafi Mat
Hassan should be convicted for culpable homicide and not for the murder of
computer engineer Noor Suzaily Mukhtar six years ago as at the time of the
incident, he had only the intention to rape her, the Federal Court heard
today.
Counsel Hamid Sultan Abu Backer (rpt: Hamid Sultan Abu Backer), who was
appointed by the court to represent Hanafi, submitted the rape and murder
charges preferred against Hanafi were prejudicial as the prosecution failed
to show that the two offences took place separately and not during the
course of committing rape which resulted in her death.
He said although, the pathologist's evidence had showed that she
(Suzaily) died of strangulation, it might have been committed accidentally
in the course of committing rape.
He said he did not condone the act of rape, but in sexual intercourse
offences, it was not unusual for the man to place his hands around his
victim which may result in him exerting more external pressure if the
victim was resisting.
He said based on the facts of the case, there was only mens rea
(intention) for rape and not murder, adding that the prosecution did not
show the mens rea for rape shifting to that of murder.
Hanafi, 38, who has been married four times, is appealing against the
Court of Appeal's decision upholding the Shah Alam High Court's decision to
convict and sentence him to death for the murder of Suzaily and also the 20
years jail term and 12 strokes of rotan for raping Suzaily.
This is the final avenue for Hanafi to appeal against the decision.
The five-men bench comprising Justice Datuk Abdul Hamid Mohamad, Datuk
Alaudin Sheriff, Datuk Arifin Zakaria, Datuk Abdul Aziz Mohamed and Datuk
Azmel Ma'amor will deliver their decision tomorrow.
Hanafi, from Kampung Renek, Kota Baharu, Kelantan, was found guilty by
the High Court for raping and killing Suzaily between 8.50 am at Lorong
Pegaga, Taman Chi Liung and 9.15 am on Oct 7, 2000 on a road at the Taman
Bukit Tinggi Klang construction site.
Hamid also submitted that the 44 injuries and fracture of one of the
neck bones sustained by Suzaily were also insufficient to establish
Hanafi's intention to murder her as there was no clear evidence before the
court to show which were the injuries before her death and after her death.
Hamid said the High Court erred in law and fact when it sentenced
Hanafi for the rape offence when the prosecution did not specifically
establish beyond reasonable doubt that the act of penetration for rape took
place whilst Suzaily was alive.
DPP Mohamad Hanafiah Zakaria submitted that Suzaily was still alive
when she was raped by Hanafi as there were multiple injuries on her body
which gave rise to irresistible inference that she was not a consenting
party to the coitus.
He said the injuries sustained by Suzaily, including the abrasion wound
around her private part area and hymenal tear, indicated that she resisted
when she was subjected to sexual intercourse, adding that if she was dead,
injury would not be detected as a dead person could not resist.
He also said there was cogent evidence to conclude that penetration on
the deceased by Hanafi was done whilst she was alive.
Hanafiah said Hanafi had raped Suzaily as DNA analysis confirmed the
seminal stain belonged to him.

"NIK AZIZ BLAMES MEDIA FOR RAPE, MURDER CASES
KOTA BAHARU, Feb 12 (Bernama) -- Kelantan Menteri Besar Datuk Nik Abdul
Aziz Nik Mat today attributed the many rape and murder cases being reported
in the country to the mass media's publication and airing of photographs of
women who displayed their ""aurat"" (flesh that should remain covered).
He said the mass media's influence in this country was very strong and
so newspapers and television should play more of an educating role and not
go overboard in publishing or airing photographs of women.
When such pictures were aired or published, men with no faith would
have their imagination stirred and this would lead them to commit the crime
of rape, murder and so on, he told reporters after opening the ""Kelantan
Women's Conference 2004"" here.
He suggested that the mass media set up a special body to decide on
what pictures to publish and what stories to run so as to create a good
image to society.
He also said the faith of present-day society in their religions was
being eroded and noted that all religious exhorted their followers to be
good and respect each other.

PETALING JAYA, May 12 (Bernama) -- Police have launched a manhunt for
11 suspected rapists believed to be involved in two rape cases.
The first incident happened last Saturday and the second, yesterday,
involving an Indonesian woman in Sungai Buloh.
Deputy Petaling OCPD ACP Hassan Abdul Rahman said police were looking
for the 11 men, aged between 20 and 25.
""In the latest incident at 11.30am yesterday, an Indonesian woman, aged
26, was raped by a youth while she was sleeping in her house in Kampung

He said the victim, who worked in a telecomunications shop, met the
youth only last week.
The youth had made amorous advances to her but she apparently rejected
them and this angered him to take revenge on her, he said.
He said the other incident happened last Saturday at a shed in the
Rubber Research Institute (RRI) in Jalan Subang, where a girl, 19, was gang
raped by 10 men.
The victim, who worked in Sungai Way, had earlier gone to Ulu Yam
recreation park with her boyfriend where they had dinner in Kota Damansara
together with at least 10 other men.
Hassan said one of the men later offered to send her home with his
motorcycle but instead her somewhere else where where the 10 men waited and

"30 YEARS JAIL TERM PROPOSED FOR RAPE
Parliament-Rape
KUALA LUMPUR, July 12 (Bernama) -- Rape will be punishable by up to 30
years jail and whipping compared to the present maximum 20 years plus
whipping under an amendment to the Penal Code tabled in the Dewan Rakyat
today.
Home Affairs Minister Datuk Seri Mohd Radzi Sheikh Ahmad, who moved the
amendment bill, said the most severe penalty would be applied in cases of a
man committing gang rape or rape in the presence of others, rape resulting
in injury to the victim or others and rape of a pregnant woman.
He said the maximum penalty would also be applied in the case of man
who raped a woman below 16 years without her consent, raped a girl below 12
years with or without her consent or raped a woman by using his position of
""The penalty for all these categories of rape is a minimum jail term of
five years to a maximum of 30 years and could include whipping,"" he said.
In other categories of rape, there is no minimum jail term and the
maximum remains at 20 years plus whipping, he added.
The proposed changes to the Penal Code were recommended by a
parliamentary select committee which conducted public hearings.
In the case of incest, Radzi said the present minimum 15 years jail
would be reduced to eight years because it was felt the longer imprisonment
discouraged the victim from reporting the crime.
He said the committee recommended that the death sentence for rape that
caused the death of the victim be replaced with either the death sentence
or a minimum 15 years jail to a maximum 30 years plus not less than 10
strokes of the cane.
""The change in the punishment is based on the consideration that the
accused in some rape cases did not have the intention to cause the death of
his victim,"" he said.
He said the bill introduced a new section that provides for a maximum
sentence of 20 years jail and whipping for a person having sex with another
by inserting an object in the vagina or anus without the other person's
consent.
On the issue of marital rape, Radzi said the committee did not agree
that it be made an offence in Malaysia on the ground that it would be
inconsistent with the syariah and the practices of other religions.
However, he said, the committee recommended the inclusion of a
provision to punish a husband who injured his wife or placed her or others
in fear of death or injury with the intention of having sex with her.
""The offence is punishable by a jail term not exceeding five years.
This punishment does not conflict with the principles of any religion. In
this context, the stress is on injury caused by a husband against his
wife,"" he said.
Radzi said the bill also proposed to reclassfify snatch theft as
robbery that would be punishable by the higher imprisonment of up to 14
years plus whipping instead of seven years for theft.
Another change to the Penal Code is abolishing the distinction between
an offence of criminal intrusion committed in daytime or night.
Radzi said the distinction was no longer practical and effective.

"JUDGE ORDERS ARREST OF FOUR US MARINES ACCUSED OF RAPE
Philippines-Americans
MANILA Jan 13 (Bernama) -- Defying political pressure, a Philippine
judge today issued warrants of arrest for four visiting United States (US)
marines accused of raping a Filipina last November.
Ordered arrested were Staff Sergeant Chad Brian Carpentier and Lance
Corporals Daniel Smith, Keith Silkwood, and Dominic Duplantis of the 31st
US Marine Expeditionary Force stationed in Okinawa, Japan.
They were part of a US contingent participating in joint military
exercises late last year with Filipino troops when they figured in an
alleged rape case inside Subic freeport, a former American naval base,
northeast of Manila.
Renato Dilag, presiding judge of the regional trial court in Olongapo
city, excluded however Timoteo Soriano, the Filipino driver of the accused,
from the warrants of arrest.
Soriano, driver of the van carrying the four US marines and the rape
victim, had earlier admitted to investigators that he witnessed the crime,
but later retracted it, saying the police coerced him to sign a statement
against his will.
Though indicted by state prosecutors as an accomplice in the commission
of the crime, the judge ruled that Soriano's inclusion as an accused was ""a
mere hindsight or an afterthought.""
Judge Dilag ordered the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), the law
enforcement unit of the Department of Justice, to serve the arrest warrants
against the accused.
NBI officials said, however, they would course the arrest warrants
through the Department of Foreign Affairs since the case is covered by the
Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) between the Philippines and the United
States.
The VFA, part of a bilateral defence cooperation, allows US security
forces to hold military training exercises with their Filipino counterparts
on Philippine soil.
The US embassy in Manila has insisted on taking custody of the four
American marines despite requests of Philippine officials to turn them over
to the local police.
In a statement, the US embassy said the VFA allows the accused to
remain in US custody until the end of judicial proceedings.
""They are restricted to quarters, and they have no official working
role at the US Embassy,"" it said.
It assured, however, that the US was taking the Philippine government's
request for custody of the accused into full account.
""The US will continue to cooperate with Philippine authorities in
accordance with the VFA as the case moves to trial under Philippine
jurisdiction,"" it said.
The embassy argued that it is a principle of Philippine and American
law that anyone accused of a crime is presumed innocent until proven
guilty.
""The US remains committed to seeing that justice is served, and looks
forward to a fair and impartial process that can provide for a just
outcome,"" it added.
In his statement, the judge urged Philippine authorities to exhaust
diplomatic means to get custody of the four American servicemen, noting
that the ""matter of sovereignty and national pride has set in"" in this
high-profile rape case.
""After all, we are a civilized nation and we adhere to the tenets of
international law. The strong arm of the law is not yet necessary at this
point,"" Judge Dilag said.

"WOMEN'S DRESSING SOURCE OF RAPE A MYTH
Rape
PENANG, May 13 (Bernama) -- Young girls and boys on reaching the age of
puberty will naturally take an interest in each other as well as in their
private parts.
This is a biological development which comes naturally, according to
Zulkiple Ibrahim, an honours graduate of Universiti Malaya.
To control this interest and the sexual urge, self-discipline is
important, he said in an interview.
Men in particular should respect the feelings of the woman and not
think only of his own satisfaction and lust, he said.
Here religion played an important role, whereby the young is taught to
respect their sexual gifts and use them correctly for procreation when the
time came, he said.
On the myth that dressing was a factor which invited rape, well this
was not the factor as fully-clothed women, underage girls, ladies who are
all covered up complete with headscarf have also be forced into sex or
raped.
Executive Director of the Women's Care Centre (WCC) here Loh Cheng Kooi
said men should also control their sexual urge and apply self-discipline
and refrain from committing rape.
She noted that conservative religious teachers claimed that women's
refusal to cover their ""aurat"" invited rape by irresponsible men who had no
self-discipline.
Loh said teachers should impress upon boys and girls the need for
mutual respect and to develop good values.
As rape was a serious offence, all parties including parents, teachers,
community leaders and non-governmental organisations should pay serious
attention to this problem, she said.
On the WCC, Loh said it was founded about 10 years ago and helped women
facing internal crisis and also women and children who were victims of
abuse and also those who were mentally disturbed.
She said the WCC provided counselling and emotional support to victims
of abuse and temporary shelter to battered women.
It also helped them to get medical and police help, she added.
She was happy to note that the Prime Minister, Datuk Abdullah Ahmad
Badawi, during his recent meeting with the NGOs had urged the media to
highlight cases of abuse and violence against women and children.
The Prime Minister had said that in 2002, a total of 1,418 cases of
sexual crime were reported an increase of 17 per cent or 1,210 cases
compared to 2000. Of these 50 to 60 per cent involved girls below the age
of 16.
Loh said the WCC had organised a six-week programme themed ""Building a
Healthy Relationship"" for some 3,000 secondary school girls from Penang
between March and April.
A similar programme for boys will be held in September.
""We are selecting children from rural schools and the focus will be on
Malay students. We want to change their mindset on dating and girl-boy
relationship as well as the relationship between adopted brothers and
sisters,"" Loh said.
They would be exposed to healthy relationship and unhealthy
relationship, the best way of ending an unhealthy relationship, avoiding
sex-based relationship and to know the difference between rape and sex and
ways of avoiding rape.

"ISSUE ON MARITAL RAPE ACTIVELY DEBATED IN PARLIAMENT
Parliament-Code (Marital Rape)
KUALA LUMPUR, July 13 (Bernama) -- The issue on marital rape became a
hot topic among Members of Parliament during the debate on the Penal Code
(Amendment) Bill 2004 at the Dewan Rakyat today.
Razali Ibrahim (BN-Muar) expressed concern over the possible inclusion
of an article on marital rape in the Penal Code as it could jeopardise the
structure of the family institution in this country.
""We fear that family harmony may no longer exist if this article were
to be included in the code,"" he said when debating the matter.
Yesterday, Home Minister Datuk Radzi Sheikh Ahmad, when tabling the
bill, said that a new provision that was proposed for inclusion in the code
was that if a man had caused injury to his wife or placed his wife or other
people in fear of death or injury for the purpose of having sex, he would
be committing a crime which could carry a jail term of not more than five
years.
Razali said more and more women in the country were aware of their
rights and there was a possibility that irresponsible groups would try to
exploit the proposed provision for their personal gain.
""For material gain, a wife may be willing to accuse her husband of rape
and subsequently use it as a ground for divorce and receive part of the
matrimonial property,"" he said.
However, he concurred that there was a need for a special provision to
protect the wife from being abused by her husband who could not contain his
desire to the extent that it could endanger her life.
""Matrimony is not purely for the purpose of sexual relations but there
are many other things involved such as nurturing love and so on,"" Razali
said.
Wong Nai Chee (BN-Kota Melaka) said the tabling of the bill should
reflect a higher sense of civic mindedness among the people.
Considering that the Penal Code represented a group of criminal laws
which formed part of the secular law, he said its amendment should be
discussed without touching religious factors.
He said marital rape had been accepted as having been practised in
several developed countries which had already enforced specific laws to
handle such cases.
He said it was inappropriate to say that the family institution would
be jeoardised because a wife who reported sexual violence such as marital
rape certainly did not enjoy a happy family life anymore.
Datuk Mohd Zaid Ibrahim (BN-Kota Baharu) said Islamic religious
education could not accept `matrimonial rape' in its terminology.
He urged the government to reconsider its decision to include the
article in the proposed amendment.
Datuk Raja Ahmad Zainuddin Raja Omar (BN-Larut) said the position of
the wife in the family could be jeopardised if she were willing to lodge a
rape complaint against her husband.
The Dewan Rakyat will sit again on Monday.

Bukit Aman Criminal Investigation Deputy Director (Intelligence and

"ARTISTS' PROSTITUTION CASE STARTS
Court-artistes (pix)
KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 13 (Bernama) -- The Sessions Court hearing the case
of two people charged with acting as intermediaries in a sex-for-hire ring
was today told how a police officer went undercover as an entrepreneur
seeking sexual favours in a sting project.
Chief Insp Roseli Ahmad, the deputy head of the Anti-Vice and Gambling
division of the Kuala Lumpur police contingent headquarters, said the sting
project was conducted at a room in Ming Court Hotel in Jalan Ampang, here,
at 6pm on June 27 this year.
He was directed by the division's chief, DSP Takbir Ahmad, to try and
get photographs of the girl naked in the room for use as evidence and to
arrest the girl if she got suspicious.
Roseli was testifying at the trial of film production house manager
Haslinda Merican M.A Merican, 30, and financial consultant Mohamed Amin
Jamadi, 27, who are charged with acting as intermediaries to four female
artistes aged between 18 and 35 for prostitution purposes at the Ming Court
Hotel lobby between 8pm and 10.30pm on June 27 this year.
They are charged under section 16 (1)(k) of the Women and Girls
Protection Act which carries a maximum five years' jail or RM10,000 fine,
or both, on conviction.
He said detektif koperal Ong Teck, who was to assist him in taking the
photographs, was to hide in a cupboard in the room and DSP Takbir and the
other members of the sting team left the room after the briefing.
At about 10pm there was a knock on the door and Ong got into the
cupboard with his Poloroid camera, he said, adding that at that time he was
clad in briefs and a towel.
He invited the girl in and they sat down and chatted, he said, adding
that the girl sported short hair but took off her wig when he told her that
she would look prettier with long hair.
After a short conversation he unbuttoned one of the buttons on the
girl's dress and she stripped herself.
He made her lie sideways on the bed and got on top of her before making
a hand signal to Ong to snap the girl's photographs, he said.
After Ong took the photographs, he identified himself as a police
officer, arrested the girl and let Takbir and the sting team into the room,
he said.
Roseli said he did not know the girl and did not discuss any payment
with her nor did he know her motive when she entered the room but from the
way she took off her clothes he believed that she was offering him sexual
favours.
He said the girl was calm and did not appear shy or afraid when he made
her lie on the bed.
Earlier, Chief Insp Lee Wai Leong of the same division said he arrested
four women including Haslinda on suspicion of conducting vice activities at
the Ming Court hotel lobby at about 10pm on June 27 this year.
Cross-examined by defence counsel Karpal Singh, for Haslinda, he said
he arrested them because of the way they behaved and dressed.
Lee said he arrested them after receiving instructions from Takbir on
his handphone and admitted that it was a trap.
The hearing before judge Zura Yahya was adhourned to Jan 8 next year.

today that no suspect was charged for the rape of her eight-year-old

The 32-year-old woman said when she asked why no suspects were
arrested, she was told that the investigation was still being carried out.
She said her daughter identified the photographs of two men who had
allegedly raped her on July 12, 2001 to the police but no action had been
taken since.
""Until today, my daughter had not testified in any courts on her rape
case,"" she said when cross-examined by her lawyer M. Manoharan.
She was called as the first witness in her suit against the police and
the government for negligence and failure to safeguard the security of the
society.
In her suit filed on Nov 23, 2001, the woman named Hulu Langat police
district chief, Sentul police district chief, Kuala Lumpur police chief,
Inspector-General of Police and the government as defendants.
She is seeking RM450,500 in special damages.
She said although she had lodged 15 police reports including the rape
of her daughter, assault on her son, break-in and a death threat, until
today police had not called her to attend an identification parade or told
her the progress on the investigation.
The women said in all her reports, she told police that the supects

Appeal here today to serve his five-year jail sentence from today for a
rape offence he had committed 12 years ago after his appeal against
conviction and sentence was rejected by the court.
Justices Datuk Mokhtar Sidin, Datuk James Foong and Datuk Zulkefli
Ahmad Makinuddin unanimously upheld the Kota Bahru's High Court's decision
to sentence Mohd Nasir Ismail to five years' jail and three strokes of
rotan for raping a 19-year old woman in a bush in the Kampung Banggol area,
Kota Bahru at 1 am, Nov 27, 1994.
Mohd Nasir who was handcuffed by the police after the court's decision,
was convicted and sentenced to eight years jail and three strokes of rotan
by the Kota Bahru Sessions Court on June 26 1997 but upon appeal to the
High Court, his sentence was reduced to five years.
He was released on bail of RM10,000 with one surety pending appeal.
When asked by the court whether he had anything to say, Mohd Nasir who
worked as a labourer in Singapore, pleaded for a reduced sentence.
Justice Mokhtar said: ""dah dua kali pohon hukuman ringan, tidak boleh
lah. Masa dulu seronok-seronok bersama orang lain."" (""you have pleaded for
a reduced sentence twice, no I can't allow that. You were then having fun
with other people.""
The judge said this was a case of gang-rape case and that he
sympathised with Mohd Nasir because that Mohd Nasir was the only one that
was arrested.
Earlier, Justice Mokhtar questioned Mohd Nasir's counsel Ahmad Nizam
Mohamed whether he still wanted to proceed with the appeal as the jail term
was already reduced to five years by the High Court.
He said this was a case of gang rape where nine people were involved
and that if he was the High Court judge, he would increase the sentence and
that nowadays, sentence for such offence was higher.
He said "" What do you expect. Let him loose and gather four persons and
do the same thing again.""
When asked by the court, DPP Noorin Badaruddin said the prosecution did
not cross appeal against the High Court's decision to reduce his jail
sentence.
Ahmad Nizam then asked the court to stand down the matter for a while
to enable him to consult Mohd Nasir. However, when the case was called up
once again, Ahmad Nizam said the client wanted to proceed with the appeal.
Earlier, Mohd Nasir's counsel Ahmad Nizam Mohamed argued that
identification by the victim on Mohd Nasir's involvement in the rape was
very weak.

PUTRAJAYA, Feb 15 (Bernama) -- The Customs Department yesterday seized
a total of 42 kilogrammes of the ""Rape Drug"" Ketamine after the arrests of
two Indian nationals at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) in
Sepang yesterday.
Its director-general Datuk Abd Rahman Hamid today said based on the
""modus operandi"", the two men were believed to be part of an international
drug smuggling syndicate.
""Both men were detained and the drugs were seized after the Customs
officers noticed their suspicious behaviour during Customs inspection at
KLIA.
""Generally, the officers can detect a suspicious character based on the
body anguage for example trying to hide behind a bigger person, unnatural
behaviour, nervousness, sweaty nose or avoiding eye contact with the
Customs officers,"" he said.
The seized drugs were estimated to worth RM820,000, and their market
value could jump by more than 10 times after being processed, he told
reporters here today.
Rahman said in the first case, a man, aged 34, was detained at 11.30 am
with 15 kilogrammes of Ketamine, worth about RM300,000, that were put
inside 40 boxes and kept in a bag.
The drugs were packed inside a box marked and labelled ""Instant Health
Mix"" and ""Energy Flour"".
The man was on a journey from Chennai, India to KLIA with transit in
Singapore.
Two hours later, another man, 27, was detained with 27 kilogrammes of
Ketamine in 25 coffee packages marked Cafeina that were kept in a bag. The
estimated value of the drugs was RM520,000.
The man was also on a journey from Chennai to KLIA but had transit in
Bangkok.
Rahman said the two suspects will be charged under Section 39B of the
Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 which carries a mandatory death by hanging upon
conviction.
Ketamine is an anaesthetic abused for its hallucinogenic properties. It
is popularly known as the ""Date Rape"" drug used mostly by those frequenting
dance clubs as drinks can easily be ""spiked"" due to its liquid and powder
forms.
In another case, the Customs Department also detained a local, aged 46,
and seized 15 kilogrammes of ganja worth RM30,000 at the Rantau Panjang
entry point last Sunday, he said.
For the whole of last year, the department had seized various types of

SUNGAI PETANI, Jan 17 (Bernama) -- Six men have been remanded for seven
days to assist the investigation into the rape-cum-murder of a jogger near
the Cinta Sayang Club here last Sunday.
The men, aged between 20 and 40, who reportedly work at the exclusive

Chee Gaik Yap, 25, a marketing executive of a factory here, was raped

Her remains were cremated at a Siamese temple in Sungai Pasir at 2.30
pm today. Also present was MCA Kedah Chairman Datuk Beh Heng Seong.
Her father, Chee Ah Sau, 49, when met at the Yee Foong Association's
funeral parlour, expressed regret with the delayed response of the police
and Cinta Sayang Club security personnel to a call for help by the victim's
younger sister, Gaik Choon.
He said Gaik Choon, who was jogging with the victim, had sought help
from the club's security personnel to find her sister after seeing traces
of blood on the road near the security post.
""But the security guards did not do anything to find my daughter
although they were told of blood stains near the guard post. At that time,
a police patrol car passed by and my daughter told the policemen of the
incident,"" he said.
But the police did not comb the area to find Gaik Yap, he said.
Gaik Yap was reported missing at 6 pm on Saturday and her body was
found by a passer-by at 2.35 am the next day.
""I am sure that if the police had acted quickly, she could have been

Those who called for a heavier sentence, like life imprisonment and
caning as well as for incest, included Datuk Lim Bee Kau (BN-Padang Serai)

Meanwhile, Datuk Ismail Sabri Yaakob (BN-Bera), raised the question on

As such, having a child-friendly atmosphere would motivate the victims

Dr Siti Zaharah said parents should explain to their children the
meaning of sexual abuse and that the abusers would be punished under the

""Don't be afraid of the abusers,"" she said.
She said the government viewed the problem seriously.
The ministry, she said, had proposed a national action plan to address

"SEXUAL DISORDER CAUSE OF CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE, SAYS EXPERT
Expert-Child Abuse
KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 19 (Bernama) -- Late in June, a six-year-old girl
was found half naked with blood stains on her clothes near her
kindergarten, six hours after she was suspected of having been abducted by
a stranger.
According to the police report, the girl was believed to have been
approached by a man wearing a yellow T-shirt and black crash helmet, asking
her to help him find his missing cat with the promise of an ice-cream in
return.
The man was said to have taken the girl on his motorcycle to a house
where she was sexually abused.
On Monday, the lifeless, naked body of a girl, aged about six, was
found in a bag near the steps of a shoplot in Petaling Jaya.
A post-mortem on the child found that she had been sexually abused
before she was killed.
The discovery of the dead body has been connected to the case of
eight-year-old Nurin Jazlin Jazimin who has gone missing for 30 days now.
However, this can only be confirmed by the results of a DNA test in about a
week's time.
These were among hundreds of reported cases of child sexual abuse while
many more could have gone unreported.
So, the question arises as to what drove some individuals to act
violently against helpless children who should instead be loved and
protected.
A lecturer in psychology at the Faculty of Communicaiton and Media
Studies, University Technology Mara, Dr Amelia Abd Aziz said those who
committed such heinous acts against children to satisfy their lust had a
sexual disorder.
She said their abnormal sexual desire for children caused them to prey
on them rather than on adults.
""They find sexual gratification by inflicting pain on children by
inserting objects like a cucumber or brinjal into their victims' private
parts,"" she added when contacted by Bernama today.
Amelia said these ""disturbed"" individuals were abnormal mentally and
psychologically, but smart enough to dupe children by pretending to be kind

Consultant psychiatrist at the Gleneagles Intan Medical Centre, Dr Nor
Hamidah Mohd Salleh said those with a sexual disorder would go around
looking for victims.
""They usually pick on seemingly likeable children, and use gentle
persuasion while displaying affection so that their intended victims would
follow them.
""These children are too naive to differentiate between good and bad
people who approach them,"" she added.
Dr Nor Hamidah said the pressures of living and mental problems were
among the causes of sexual disorder.
She said parents should closely watch their children's movements to
prevent any untoward incident.
Meanwhile, the father of a five-year-old girl who had been sexually
molested in Kampung Baru here, described the crime against his child as
terribly cruel.
""Those who commit such a crime are masking themselves as human beings
when actually they behave like animals.
""I am thankful that my daughter was not murdered like what happened to
some children. But I am still angry as the culprit has not been caught,""
added the victim's father who wished anonymity.
He said the culprit did the same thing to his daughter and the other
child victims in Kampung Baru.
""We do not know whether the crime was committed by the same person but
the method used was the same, by inserting an object into the victim's

"LAWMAKERS WANT ""RAPE"" OF LOJING TO STOP IMMEDIATELY
Parliament-Debate (Lojing)
KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 19 (Bernama) -- The Natural Resources and Environment
Ministry was once again urged to stop illegal logging in the Lojing
Highlands, Gua Musang.
A number of backbenchers said they wanted stern action against the
""raping"" of the highland forest by irresponsible parties for the area to be
inherited by future generations.
Datuk Mohamed Aziz (BN-Sri Gading) said exploiting the highland forest
with the excuse of looking for gold had actually resulted in its
destruction.
""The failure of the Kelantan PAS government to stop the destruction
should not be allowed to continue. Otherwise, the future of our young
generation will be threatened,"" he said, interjecting the debate by Datuk
Ir Shaari Hasan (BN-Tanah Merah) on the 2008 Suppy Bill in the Dewan Rakyat
here today.
Mohamed Aziz said although the Lojing Highlands were under the
jurisdiction of the state government, he hoped the ministry would be able
to do something fast to save the forest there.
His views were supported by Shaari who slammed the state government for
its greed in enriching itself from the forest resources.
""Today, we know that some of the forests in Kelantan have gone. The
timber planted by the Barisan Nasional government 20 to 30 years ago have
been felled with no efforts made to replant the trees and rehabilitate the
logged areas.
""This is because the state government only thinks of the present needs
without thinking of the interest of future generations.""
Therefore, an immediate solution to the problem must be found and the
encroachment and destruction of the Lojing Highlands be exposed to the
public, he added.
Datuk Che Min Che Ahmad (BN-Pasir Puteh) who joined the debate, said
the development projects carried out in the highlands would only serve to
destroy its valuable resources.
""If the BN takes over the state, what else is left?"" he asked.
Datuk Ismail Abd. Mutalib (BN-Maran) said illegal logging in the Lojing
Highlands would have detrimental effects on the local Orang Asli as they
would lose their sources of income such as the rattan and bamboo found in
the area.

The illegal sales of babies arose because those women, who were

Prostitutes-Tent
KUALA LUMPUR, May 22 (Bernama) -- Some 25,000 foreigners are working
round the clock to complete the new Kuala Lumpur International Airport in
Sepang near here while another smaller group of foreigners are apparently
providing a different sort of support service for these workers.
In the cool breeze among oil palm trees, prostitutes said to be from
Thailand, are satisfying the sexual urge of these men in hastily erected
tents with zinc and plastic sheets separating one cubicle from another.
""They have also brought in mattresses for these tents,"" Sepang OCPD
Deputy Superintendent Asri Yusoff told Bernama in an interview.
The ""strike tents"" order goes out as soon the people behind these
activities get wind of any information that ""outsiders"" had come to know
about the goings on within the tents. They then pitch camp elsewhere among
the large tracts of oil palm land that fringe the airport ground.
Nevertheless, the well-informed police caught six Thai women aged
between 23 and 37 in the tent at about 11.40pm on Friday.
Police would have expected to catch some foreigners patronising the
women but it was not to be so -- the six men who were in the company of the
women were Malaysians aged between 18 and 33.
Investigations revealed that the tents would be around in a particular
area of the plantation for about two weeks before a new place was found
within the vast oil palm plantation itself, Supt Asri said.
He said ""guards"" had been posted at strategic points to warn the ""camp
and this had prevented police from catching these people earlier.
""Their people are at every corner to ensure that the tent situation was
under control,"" he said.
The tent activities had become popular in view of the high demand for
the service and the good income which the women had been receiving, he
added.
Recently, police detained 16 women suspected to be prostitutes in the
hawkers area near the airport site.
Supt Asri said the six foreign women and the six Malaysian men were

"HARD TO ACCEPT LAWS THAT REQUIRE SPECIFIC DATES FOR RAPE CHARGES
Umno-Rafidah (Rape)
KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 22 (Bernama) -- Rules that require specific dates
and times to be stated in rape charges are hard to accept, Wanita Umno
chief Datuk Seri Rafidah Aziz said today.
She said that if these rules were put into practice, the women would
not be vindicated by the law.
Rape was something traumatic to a woman and it was difficult for the
victim to remember the exact date and time of the offence, she said in her
policy speech at Wanita Umno general assembly at Dewan Tun Hussein Onn at
the Putra World Trade Centre, here.
She said it was even harder if the rapist was a family member and a
repeat offender.
""Rape victims, especially the young, will suffer depression and trauma
and are unlikely to report the incident immediately,"" she said.
Rafidah said the laws should champion women and rectify the situation
because oppressed women needed protection and vindication.
Moreover, incidents like rape, oppression and violence against women
which involved family members or foreigners were so prevalent now, she
said.
""In nearly all the incidents, women are the unwilling victims,"" said
Rafidah, who is International Trade and Industry Minister.
Recently Attorney-General Tan Sri Abdul Gani Patail was reported as
saying that half of the cases with the Attorney-General's Chambers now
might have to be thrown out if the courts required criminal charges to
contain dates in detail.
He also said that if that was the position, he would have to review all
the cases to ensure that the dates in the charges were accurate.
On Sept 6 this year, the Court of Appeal allowed an appeal by a janitor
and set aside his conviction and sentence of 18 years and eight strokes of
the rotan on four counts of raping his daughter after ruling that the
charges did not specify the times and dates of the offences.
He had served seven years in jail after his conviction by the Sessions
Curt.

"WANITA UMNO WANTS LAW ON RAPE REVIEWED
Umno-Rafidah (Reaction)
KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 22 (Bernama) -- Wanita Umno supports views that the
law on rape which now emphasises on accurate date and time of the offence
as the basis for trial be reviewed.
An exco member, Ilani Isahak, said that laws were supposed to uphold
and give priority to justice.
She was commenting on the statement made by Wanita Umno head, Datuk
Seri Rafidah Aziz, in her speech at the Wanita assembly today.
Various parties have expressed concern over the inability to bring rape
cases to the court for justice just because the victims could not remember
the actual time and dates of the crime.
This followed the decision made by the Appeal Court early last month to
allow a man's appeal to set aside the 18-year jail term and eight strokes
of the rotan imposed on him for raping his daughter.
Ilani, a lawyer by profession, said if the accuracy of date and time
has to be taken into consideration in rape cases, the fate of the majority
of rape victims would not be protected.
""Therefore, laws on the matter should be amended and given attention by
the authorities,"" she told reporters.
She said Wanita Umno is duty-bound to guide female students in choosing
their area of studies when they enter universities.
The new permanent chairman of Wanita Umno, Datuk Napsiah Omar, said
women should understand and learn more about the law so that they could
help rectify ""what is painful to women"".
She agreed with Rafidah that women should be well equipped to face the
future challenges through Information and Communication Technology (ICT) so
they would not be left behin in the tide of globalisation.
""We must make sure we have the knowledge which is consistent with the
requirement and the times in order to compete and succeed,"" she said.
Another exco member, Dr Robia Kosai, said that Rafidah's speech has
injected a new spirit in Wanita members to wake up and compete with others
in this globalisation era.
It was time, she said, that women join the men in making decisions and
eliminate any element of discrimination to achieve greater success.

COURT-RAPE
KOTA KINABALU, Oct 22 (Bernama) -- The Sessions Court here today ruled that
the prosecution has estabilished a prima facie case against a former private
school teacher on two counts of raping an 11-year-old Singaporean girl who was
previously his student.
However, judge Duncan Sikodol dismissed another count of rape and two other
charges of oral sex and sodomy against Adrian Simon.
In his ruling, Sikodol, who noted from evidence adduced by the victim that
she had a crush on the 31-year-old accused, said among others, the prosecution
had proven sexual penetration and that the victim was underage and therefore,
consent was irrelevant.
The trial was fixed for Nov 3, for defence to be called.
On the first count (amended charge), Adrian is charged with raping the girl
at the science laboratory store room of a school in Likas near here between
February and March this year, between 2.10pm and 3.30pm.
On the second count, he is alleged to have committed the same offence at the

"GARDENER FREED FROM 20 YEARS' JAIL SENTENCE FOR ALLEGED RAPE OF DAUGHTER
COURT-RAPE (APPEAL)
PUTRAJAYA, Jan 23 (Bernama) -- A gardener who was sentenced to 20 years'
jail for allegedly raping his daughter was freed by the Appeals Court here today
after it ruled that his joint trial for the two rape charges in the Sessions
Court was null and void.
The panel, comprising Appeals Court President Tan Sri Zaki Tun Azmi (now
Chief Justice) and Appeals Court Judges Datuk James Foong and K.N. Segara
unanimously allowed the gardener's appeal and set aside the conviction and
sentence on both charges imposed by the Sessions Court.
The court held that the two alleged offences, one occurring in October 1992
and the second in 1995, were not committed within the space of 12 months, and
therefore could not be tried jointly under Section 164 of the Criminal Procedure
Code (CPC).
""We wish to observe that rape is not a continuing offence but a single act
of unlawful sexual intercourse. When a charge prejudices the accused to a fair
trial by not being able to legitimately raise a defence of alibi, that charge
must be deemed defective,"" said Justice Segara in his written judgment.
He said the appellant (name withheld) ought to have been tried
separately on the two charges and the failure had resulted in an illegality.
""On the face of the two charges, the two offences could have occurred up to
three years apart. There is clear absence of proximity of time between the two
offences for continuity of action and purpose, to render the acts to have been
done in one series so connected together as to form the same transaction.
""We are of the view that this is obviously not a case in which the two
charges can be tried together in one trial which is sanctioned by the law. The
two charges do not fall within Section 165(1) of the CPC,"" he said.
The gardener, 67, was charged with raping his daughter, 13 (at that time),
in their house in Kampung Tasek Tambahan, Ampang, Selangor, at 12.30pm in
October 1992 and between 1992 and 1995 at the same place.
He was convicted by the Sessions Court, Ampang and sentenced to 20 years'
imprisonment to run consecutively for both charges.
The High Court dismissed his appeal against the conviction, but allowed the
appeal against sentence and ordered the jail term to run concurrently. However,
the order was also set aside by the Appeals Court today.
No order for a re-trial was made, but the Public Prosecutor was at the
liberty to exercise his discretion to charge the appellant afresh, the court
said.

"PROPOSAL FOR MEDICAL STAFF TO BE EQUIPPED TO DEAL WITH SEXUAL ABUSE CASES
Abuse
KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 23 (Bernama) -- The Malaysian Association for the
Protection of Children today proposed that medical staff be well-equipped
to investigate cases of suspected sexual abuse involving children brought
to them.
Its president, Datuk Dr Mohamed Sham Kassim, said that 20 cases of
sexually-abused girls below the age of 15 who became pregnant were reported
to the Kuala Lumpur Hospital between 1985 and 1996.
He said that the actual number of such cases could be more as there
were 28,000 babies born at the hospital during that period and quite a
number of the babies were delivered by young mothers.
""The problem is they (medical staff) don't ask the victims who have
done this to them and so the problem goes on,"" he told reporters after
attender a Seminar on Medical Evaluation and Treatment of Sexually Abused
Children, here.
Dr Mohamed Sham said if that was the case, then there was a possibility
the victims might be abused again.
A low level of awareness among the public on children suspected to be
sexually abused had also been identified as one of the causes for repeated
offences, he said.
""Most people do not want to know about this problem and try to ignore
the incident,"" he added.
Meanwhile, Dr Irene Cheah Guat Sim, from the hospital's Department of
Paediatrics, in her paper ""Child Sexual Abuse - The Malaysian Experience"",
said efforts to treat sexually-abused children met with a lot of
difficulties due to various problems that arose.
She said that among the problems were poor attendance for follow-up
treatment, negative perception of seeing a psychiatrist and the
confidentiality issue.
The number of cases from the police showed that there were 719 cases in
1996 and 739 cases last year throughout the country, she said.
Dr Cheah said sexual abuse was more prevalent among girls compared to
boys with 42.8 per cent being repeated cases.
The authorities were facing problems in prosecuting such cases due to
various problems such as the testimony of a young child being inadmissible
in court, custody issues, the adult perpetrator's word against the child
and reluctance on the part of parents to charge their own relative, she
added.
The two-day seminar is organised by the association and the hospital's

primary school, here.
Adrian Simon pleaded not guilty to all charges and the case has been fixed
for mention on Aug 26 by judge Caroline Bee Majanil. The prosecution will call
15 witnesses.
On the first charge, the accused is alleged to have raped the girl, then one
of his pupils, in the science lab of the school between Feb 10 and 20, 2010,
between 2.10pm and 3.30pm.
On the second charge, he is alleged to have raped the girl at the same place

On the third charge, he is alleged to have raped the girl at the same place,
between April 1 and 7, 2010, between 2pm and 3.30pm.
All three charges are framed under Section 376(2)(e) of the Penal Code (rape
of child under 12), which carries a jail term of up to 30 years and whipping.
On the fourth and fifth charges respectively, he is accused of compelling
the girl to commit oral sex on him at the same place between Feb 10 and 20,
2010, between 2.10pm and 3.30pm, and committing sodomy at the same place between
Febuary and April, 2010, between 2.pm and 3.30pm.
Both charges are under Section 377c of the Penal Code (carnal intercourse
against the order of nature), which is punishable by a jail term of up to 20
years and whipping.
The accused was granted bail of RM8,000 with RM1,000 deposited under two

her house at 9.15 am.
Siti Syazwani was reported to have been missing since 2 pm the day
before when she did not return home from her Quran reading class held in
the same neighbourhood.
Najib said he hoped that the authorities would act swiftly to catch the
perpetrators and bring them to justice. The law provides the mandatory
death sentence for murderers.
On reports that several foreigners had been detained in relation to the
case, he said: ""Don't jump to conclusions. Let the police do their
investigation.""
He said such acts were committed because the perpetrators were
internally weak and easily influenced by unhealthy elements. When people
were controlled by desires, even a nine-year-old can become a victim, he
added.
Asked about allegations that rebels in southern Thailand had received
help from leaders and senior members of an opposition party in Malaysia,

from Thailand). Once we receive it, we will investigate and announce the
findings.""

KOTA KINABALU, May 24 (Bernama) -- A Sabah Umno division pro tem head,
who sparked an uproar following his ""off-the-cuff"" remark about rape at a
seminar here on Saturday has apologised to all, especially women who were
offended by his statement.
Kota Kinabalu Umno division pro tem head Roselan Johar Mohamed said his
remark was either misconstrued or misinterpreted.
""I did apologise for the remark. It could be in bad taste but I did not
mean for it to sound like that,"" he was reported as saying in a local daily
today.
Sabah Muslim Lawyers Association (Salwa) President Fatmah Wattie Abu
Bakar claimed she and the other guest speakers at the Legal Literacy
Seminar for Women were stunned to hear Roselan stating, among others, that
""if you cannot fight rape, better lay down and enjoy it"".
Chief Minister Datuk Seri Musa Aman said he was saddened by the remark
and would advise Roselan to be more careful.
Roselan claimed the particular phrase was a proverb he took from
Confucius.
""Please accept my humblest apology,"" he said as women organisations in
Sabah expressed outrage over the remark.
Roselan said sexual crimes were heinous acts and he shared the belief
that the offences warranted stiff punishment.

"EIGHT PROSTITUTION RINGS IDENTIFIED IN FEDERAL CAPITAL
Prostitutes
KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 24 (Bernama) -- Police have identified eight
syndicates which are actively involved in prostitution here, including
supplying foreigners to well-heeled clients.
The syndicates are known as Black Jack, Pakalog, Fah Tou, Fah Seng,
October Cherry, 42, Wong Kok and Jim Tsa Sui, according to Supt Takbir
Ahmad Nazir Mohd, the city police anti-vice and gaming branch chief.
He said these syndicates had agents to provide the services of local
and foreign prostitutes through their network called ""company"" which takes
charge of the logistics and operations of their activities.
Ismail said these syndicates also had international connections to
bring in foreigners for the local flesh trade.
Takbir Ahmad said most foreigners involved in vice turned to
prostitution while their visit passes were still valid and would head for
another country to continue their activities on the expiry of their stay
here.
There were also men who lured girls into prostitution with the promise
of a good life and money, he said.
These pimps, known as ""Loh To"", get clients for the girls under their
charge through the syndicates, he said.
He said some foreigners came to Malaysia to be prostitutes on the
encouragement of their friends who had been involved in vice in the country
before.
""Despite the strict enforcement, they are willing to take the risk
because of the big money,"" he said. -- BERNAMA

"THAI LAW ALLOWS HUSBANDS TO RAPE WIVES, VICE-VERSA
Law-Rape
BANGKOK, Jan 25 (Bernama) -- A husband can rape his wife and for the
sake of gender equality, the Thai Justice Ministry will allow the wives to
rape their husbands, too.
""Don't laugh. That is exactly what the Justice Ministry says in its
draft amendment of the law regarding rape,"" Bangkok Post's Assistant Editor
Sanitsuda Ekachai wrote in her columm today.
Under the Justice Ministry's draft amendments to the rape and divorce
laws which was criticised in the National Legislative Assembly last week,
rape and sexual offences will be punishable with a jail term from four to
20 years and a fine of 8,000 to 40,000 bahts, unless it involves marital
partners.
Sanitsuda said although the amendments would bring several improvements
to the current laws on sexual violence and divorce, continuing to endorse
marital rape is totally unacceptable.
The existing law does not protect wives from rape by their husbands
while homosexuals don't have protection either as women are defined as the
only victims of rape and sexual offence.
The amendment will also protect homosexuals from rape and sexual
harassment.
The writer said the laws on divorce and marital compensation support
men's sexual promiscuity as it allows the husbands to use adultery as
grounds for divorce but not for the wives.
""To sue for divorce, the wife must prove her husband financially
supports and publicly honours another woman as wife. Proving the husband's
unfaithfulness alone will not suffice,"" she said.
The draft is the ministry's response to years of pressure from human
rights groups to redress gender violence and inequality in Thai law but it
ends up being farcical because of the mechanical approach to justice and
its refusal to tackle the oppression of women.

them from experiencing trauma in a courtroom.
Through video recording, the victim would only have to give a single

KUALA TERENGGANU, Sept 25 (Bernama) -- A Sessions Court was told today
that a National Service (NS) trainee was asked to take an oath four times
that she had indeed been raped by a trainer at her camp.
The victim said that during a meeting she was made by camp deputy
commandant, Lt Normazuraida Zakaria, better known as Lt Aida, to swear on
God's name that the rape took place as she had said.
""I was asked to swear three times and then Lt Aida asked me to make a
written statement about the incident. After I wrote it out, Lt Aida again
asked me to take an oath that the rape by Cikgu Azmi really happened,"" she
said in examination-in-chief by Deputy Public Prosecutor Othman Abdullah.
The 18-year-old is the 11th prosecution witness in the trial of Merang,
Setiu NS camp trainer Koperal Zuki Mohd, 29, who is charged with raping her
at the Rhu Tapai agro-industry area between 7.28pm and 9.30pm on Feb 28.
The offence under Section 376 of the Penal Code provides for a maximum
jail term of 20 years and whipping upon conviction.
The girl said, also in the March 17 meeting with Aida were Prebet
Russinah Muaram and Nurul Marissa, a representative from the National
Service Training Department.
During the meeting, Aida told her a pregnancy test carried out at the
Seberang Takir camp earlier that morning showed she was pregnant.
""I was shocked and did not know what to say. I started crying and asked
permission to leave,"" she said, but added that Aida did not allow her to
leave and she was consoled by Russinah.
She said, however, that tests taken in the two consecutive days after
the meeting came back negative ""and I was so thankful to find out I was not
pregnant"".
The witness said she also handed over the shirt and trousers she was
wearing on the day of the alleged incident to investigating officer, Chief
Insp Salmiah Mahmud.
However, she did not hand over the underwear she wore on that day as
she had thrown them away some time before lodging a police report on the
incident, she said.
At the end of the examination, Othman applied to Sessions Judge Ahmad

alleged she was raped by a trainer, Kpl Zuki Mohd, told the Sessions Court

boyfriend and loved to party.
Much of what she wrote in the ""Modul Kecemerlangan Diri""
(Self-Excellence Module) book while undergoing training at Universiti Putra
Malaysia (UPM) in Serdang were fibs.
""But what is written from page 24 to 27 (relating to the rape incident)
did happen.
""The rest were fictitious written in a group activity. It's normal for
kids,"" she said when cross-examined by Mat Yusof Mohamad, the counsel for
Zuki, a former trainer at the Merang Suria Holiday Camp in Merang, Setiu.
Zuki, 29, was charged under Section 376 of the Penal Code with raping
the trainee at the Rhu Tapai Agro Industry site not far from the camp on
Feb 28 between 7.28pm and 9.30pm.
If convicted, he will face a jail term not more than 20 years and
whipping.
The victim, the 11th prosecution witness, wrote in the book that
getting a driving licence was an important thing as she already had a car,
that she loved to party and that Mohd Fairuz Abdul Rahim was her boyfriend.
She told the court that these were fictitious and she did that because
""the trainer said do what you want to do with the book"".
During cross-examination, she said she did not have a car and she was
not the type of a sociable person or liked partying.
She also denied that what she wrote from page 24 to 27 relating to the
rape incident were also fictitious.
She said she reported the rape incident to a logistics officer at the
camp, Mohd Zambri Abdul Ghani, as she was under stress following actions by
other officers in the camp.
""I was under stress because of the attitude of the chief trainer at the
camp, Encik Mustafa, who always uttered lewd words to me...the camp
commandant, on seeing me, like to touch here and there... Lt Aida once
chased me away from the medical camp,"" she said.
The victim also said she lodged the police report 45 days later after
the incident took place because of Aida.
Initially, Aida suggested to her to lodge a police report but when she
was prepared to do so, she gave no encouragement, she said.
""She told me to lodge a report when I did not want to, but when I
wanted to do it, Lt Aida told me to rethink as it would embarrass my
family,"" she said.
""At the second encounter, I asked them to bring the police to the camp
but instead she told me to swear in the name of Allah that she would not
disclose the incident while at UPM,"" she said.

"ADULTS' ROLE IS TO PROTECT CHILDREN FROM SEXUAL ABUSE
Abuse-Children
PETALING JAYA, Nov 27 (Bernama) -- All adults are responsible for
protecting all children from sexual abuse and exploitation -- that's the
message which the four-year-old Malaysian Coalition for the Prevention of
Child Sexual Abuse (MCPCSA) wants to convey.
And the 18-member grouping hopes to enlist the aid of the media through
a one-day Media Sensitisation Workshop on Nov 29.
""The media can disseminate the information further and wider than all
of us together, changing attitudes and mindsets,"" said psychological
counsellor Aggy Hooi with the Protect and Save the Children (P.S. The
Children) Association of Selangor and Kuala Lumpur, a member of the
Coalition.
Hooi praised a teacher who recently acted to help three girls at a
boarding school for the disabled who had been sexually abused.
While they were in primary school, the girls had to clean a teacher's
house as a team of three, said the counsellor.
One teacher would rape one of the girls while the other two girls were
cleaning. He took turns with the girls and paid each RM1.
""The girls were afraid to talk and did not know that the teacher had
acted inappropriately,"" said Hooi.
It was not until the three girls moved to secondary school that a
teacher overheard them talking about their experience. She asked them to
clarify and then she called a member of the Coalition.
The case is now in court while the accused is on bail pending trial.
""The secondary school teacher took an interest in the students and
followed through, making sure that action was taken--even though she risked
the loss of her job,"" said Hooi.
Sexual abuse of children includes any sexual act with a child, sexual
touching, exhibitionism or forcing the child to watch pornography or sexual
acts, forcing the child into prostitution or production of pornography, and
verbal sexual harassment.
""Pay attention to children for signs of sexual abuse,"" urged the
counsellor.
The changes may include refusing to attend school or performing badly
in school, aggressive or anxious behaviour, nightmares, trouble sleeping,
fear of the dark or a particular person or place, wearing many layers of
clothes, suicidal tendencies, low self esteem, depression, eating
disorders, drug or alcohol addiction, physical harm, sexualised behaviour
or fear of sex, bedwetting or thumb sucking (especially in older children),
venereal disease or pregnancy, and/or withdrawal from their usual
activities.
Hooi stressed that these could be symptoms of sexual abuse if
biological causes have been ruled out.
Adults can report physical child sexual abuse cases to the Teledera
hotline (1 800 883040) or P.S. The Children (03-77844344).
Within the Klang Valley, they can go to the emergency unit at Kuala
Lumpur Hospital or the University Malaya Medical Centre and ask for the
Suspected Child Abuse and Neglect (SCAN) team which includes pediatricians,
gynecologists, child psychiatrists, medical social workers, social welfare
officers and the police. The SCAN team will make police reports for cases
of child sexual abuse.
Outside the Klang Valley, they can go to the One Stop Crisis Centre at
the local general hospital.
The Coalition also stresses the need for risk reduction strategies.
""Know where your child is and who your child is with,"" said Hooi.
Abusers are not necessarily strangers, she added, noting that 95
percent of offenders are known to the children.
P.S. The Children recommends sexuality education for children aged five
and above so that they can identify their feelings, say no to sexual
behaviour, develop a support network and learn how to protect themselves.
The media workshop on Nov 29 will be a ""first"", said Lisa Zahran, who

"TER AI CHIN NOT EXAMINED AS RAPE VICTIM, COURT TOLD
Court-Newsreader
KUALA LUMPUR, May 28 (Bernama) -- The Ampang Magistrate's Court here
was today told that former Radio Television Malaysia news reader Ter Ai
Chin had not been examined as a rape victim when she was referred to the
Kuala Lumpur Hospital (HKL).
HKL Emergency Department medical officer Dr Zahirah Mohd Juraimi, 41,
said she only carried out an external examination as there had not been a
request for a rape examination on the news reader.
Zahirah said during examination, Ai Chin had mentioned that she had
sustained injuries from broken glass.
Zahirah, the prosecution's fifth witness, was recalled in the trial of
Ai Chin, 51, charged with making a false rape report against three men, at
the Ampang Police Station at 1.50pm on March 26, 1996.
The offence, under Section 182 of the Penal Code, carries a maximum
jail term of six month or RM2,000 or both upon conviction.
Magistrate Mohamad Kamil Nizam had earlier allowed the recall
application by prosecution officer S. Naidu, to ascertain facts, over
objections by Ai Chin's counsel K.C. Wan that the recall would cause
confusion in the witness.
Before the end of proceedings, Mohamad Kamil advised Naidu to trace the
other witnesses in the case to come forward and testify.
He said if efforts to do so failed, the prosecution should close its
case as the matter had been pending since 1999.
The trial continues on July 16.

Abdullah-Nurul Huda
KEPALA BATAS, Aug 28 (Bernama) -- Prime Minister Datuk Seri Abdullah
Ahmad Badawi is relieved the rape-cum-murder case of 10-year-old Nurul Huda
Gani is over.
He said the judgment on the case was delivered in accordance with the
country's laws.
""What's important, the Judge has imposed the punishment. I hope the
punishment is fair, wrongdoers will be punished,"" he said when asked to
comment on the Johor Baharu High Court's decision to impose the death
sentence on security guard Mohd Abbas Danus Baksan, 46, for murdering Nurul
Huda.
Abdullah, who is also Internal Security Minister, said he was happy the
legal process of the case proceeded smoothly without any delay and the
guilty party had been punished.
""That's what I like, what I don't like when cases are delayed,"" he
said, quoting an English saying ""Justice delayed is justice denied.""
He said if the trial or judgment of a case took too long, there might
not be justice anymore.
Nurul Huda's rape and murder sparked an outrage among Malaysians,
including Abdullah who had expressed profound sadness and regret over the
incident.
The Standard Four pupil, who was raped and sodomised, was found dead
naked in the toilet of a guardhouse in January after she left her house to
the nearby sundry shop.
On Jan 26, Abbas was convicted of raping and sodomising the girl and
was given the maximum sentence of 20 years' jail and 24 strokes of the
rotan by the Johor Baharu Sessions Court.
On abandoned housing projects, Abdullah said the government viewed the
problem seriously and had discussed ways to tackle them, including his
suggestion to introduce ""build and sell"" concept.
He said the Housing and Local Government Ministry was preparing a
Cabinet paper on the matter which is expected to be tabled soon for a
decision.
""If developers cannot sell their completed houses, it's their problem.
Although we are sad, they suffer losses but at least, it does not involve

CHINI, Pahang, Jan 29 (Bernama) -- Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri

and murder to Umno's rejection of the enforcement of the Hudud Law
introduced by PAS.
""This claim has been turned into political material as they try to

Najib, said he regretted the claim and reminded the opposition not to

"56-YEAR-OLD SENT TO 57 YEARS IN JAIL, WHIPPING FOR RAPE
COURT-RAPE
KUALA LUMPUR, April 29 (Bernama) -- A 56-year-old man with six previous
convictions, will have to spend 57 years behind bars and whipped 12 times after
the Ampang Sessions Court convicted him of raping a relative thrice.
Hamzah Dollah was found to have raped the 20-year-old woman in a container
in Kampung Sungai Tekala, Hulu Langat, at 9pm on Oct 17, 2003, and twice in a
fruit orchard hut in Kampung Tuntong, Batu 21, Jalan Sungai Lui, Hulu Langat,
at about 10pm on Oct 19 and 26, 2003.
In at least one incident, he raped the victim in front of his wife.
The offence under Section 376 of the Penal Code carries up to 30 years in
jail and not less than 10 strokes of the rotan on each count.
Judge Noradidah Ahmad ordered Hamzah to serve 18 years for the first count,
19 years for the second and 20 years for the third consecutively.
She also did not exempt the man from whipping despite his age citing the
2006 amendment to the law which allows a convicted rapist above 50 years to be
caned.
Deputy Public Prosecutor Roszianayati Ahmad told the court earlier that the
court should not consider Hamzah's age as a reason to hand down a lenient
sentence.
Hamzah was very cruel, she said. There were times when he threatened the
victim with a power saw and to throw her into a river, pour petrol on her and
bind her legs and hands.
""From witnesses' evidence the court could see how the victim was threatened
with murder, beaten up, punched and slapped on the face until one side of her
face got swollen.
""The victim was also kicked including in the stomach, punched on the
breasts and stepped on the back. What the accused did was more disgraceful than
a beast,"" she said.
She said the victim had believed in Hamzah and was willing to follow him
because she wanted to find a job.
Roszianayati said Hamzah had not repented even though he had been sent to
jail for a number of offences including theft, possesing stolen property and
breach of trust since 1978.
Instead, he committed a more serious offence this time, she said.
Hamzah was unrepresented. Before the proceedings, he asked for the
sentencing to be postponed to tomorrow saying that he was not feeling well but
the judge rejected it.
""Are you sure you will be well tomorrow?"" she asked him.
In the plea of mitigation, Hamzah appealed for the court to give concurrent
jail terms and promised to be good for his five-year-old child whom he said
needed love.
He blamed his wife for the offence he committed.
After the judge handed down the sentence, Hamzah who was cuffed, asked the
interpreter why he had to be whipped though he was over 50 years of age.

personnel charged with raping a 13-year-old girl at a temporary immigration
detention centre in Menggatal near here two years ago was acquitted and
discharged by the Sessions Court here today without their defence being
called.
In acquitting them, judge Datuk Nurchaya Arshad said she found that the
prosecution had failed to establish a prima facie case against the two men,
Mohamed Fauzee Yahya, 34, and Ahmad Nazri Zainurrdin, 33, both of Perak.
Mohamed Fauzee was charged with raping the girl at Block G of the
centre between July 27 and Aug 12 2002 while Ahmad Nazei was charged with
committing the offence at the same venue between July 27 and Aug 16 2002.
Nurchaya said the prosecution failed to establish that the alleged
incident had indeed taken place with or without the consent of the victim.
""There were no signs that the victim put up a struggle during the
alleged incident as prosecution witness Dr Soon Ruey did not find any
external injuries to the victim's private parts and no examination was
conducted to find any injuries to the accused persons.
""There was no evidence introduced by the prosecution that the victim
had shown signs or behaviour immediately after the alleged incident which
was consistent with her being forced against her will,"" she said.
Nurchaya said there was also a long delay between the time of the
alleged incident and the time of the victim's complaint which was made for
the first time in the Philippines where she was mistakenly deported along
with other Filipinos.
""The victim has alleged that the incident took place in full view of
the other guards as the room door was left open.
""The prosecution has however chosen not to call any of the other guards
to corroborate this story and I am in a real state of doubt as to whether
the incident has occurred as alleged,"" she said.
Nurchaya also said that she had doubt concerning the issue of the
victim suffering from gonorrhoea and whether the prosecution had proven
that the GOF men had sexual intercourse with her when there was no evidence
that they had contracted the disease.
On the issue of identification of the GOF men, Nurchaya said there was
a doubt from the testimony of two investigating officers as to whether the
girl did in fact gave a description of the men before their photographs
were shown to her.
""Even if the identification parade (IP) was conducted in a fair and
proper manner, its evidential value was weakened from the fact that the
victim was shown the photographs of the accused persons while she was in
the Philippines and again before the second IP was conducted,"" she said.
The prosecution had also failed to establish that the girl was under 16
years' old during the alleged incident.
Although documents were tendered to prove she was under 16, her father
as well as investigating officers had created doubts when they were unable
to rule out the possibility that it might belong or refer to some person
other than the girl, said Nurchaya.

"POLICE REARREST SUSPECT IN NURUL HUDA'S RAPE CASE ON HIS RELEASE
JOHOR BAHARU, Jan 31 (Bernama) -- A 27-year-old jobless man was
rearrested by the police on his release after a 15-day remand to facilitate
investigations into the rape and murder of 10-year-old Nurul Huda Gani at
the guardhouse of the Tenaga Nasional Berhad main intake sub-station in
Gelang Patah on Jan 17.
He was arrested under the Emergency Ordinance outside the premises of
the Magistrate's Court here which ordered his release on the expiry today
of the one-day extension of the 14-day remand order granted yesterday by
the court on the application by the police.
The Emergency Ordinance provides for a person to be detained at the
police lock-up for up to 60 days for further investigations.
The suspect was detained by the police on Jan 17 together with the
security guard engaged to guard the sub-station, at Kampung Pekajang,
Tanjung Kupang, Gelang Patah, after Nurul Huda was found on the brink of
death at the guardhouse and was remanded from that day.
Last Monday, the security guard, Mohamad Abbas Danus Baksan, 47,
pleaded guilty to raping the Standard Four pupil of Sekolah Kebangsaan
Tiram Duku in Tanjung Kupang, and was sentenced to the maximum 20 years'

"EMPLOYER FORCES INDON MAID INTO PROSTITUTION, MAID'S BABY SOLD
Police-Baby
KUALA LUMPUR, March 31 (Bernama) -- A 26-year-old Indonesian maid, who
was forced into prostitution by her employer, suffered another blow when
her newborn baby was sold by a couple whom she had trusted to take care.
Gombak OCPD ACP Massari Hashim said the woman was pregnant when she
came to Malaysia to work as a maid, leaving her husband and family in
Indonesia.
She was employed as a maid in the house of a karaoke operator who later
forced her to work at his karaoke and prostitute herself, he told reporters
after opening the Selangor state-level Police Cadet Corps at the Selayang
Municipal Council Stadium.
Massari said she was employed by the operator on Sept 15 last year
before she was lured into prostitution at the illegal karaoke in Gombak.
After working for several months, she delivered a baby on March 11 and
handed the child to an Indonesian couple to take care, he said.
He said the woman's misery did not end there as her employer forced her
to continue prostituting although she was still under confinement.
To add salt to injury, the couple, whom she had entrusted to take care
of her baby, sold the child to a Malay couple from Negeri Sembilan for
RM2,500, he said.
""The maid came to know about her missing baby when she came to visit
the child on March 24. She then lodged a police report,"" he said.
Following the report, police arrested the couple, in their 30s, and the
karaoke operator two days later.
Massari said the 42-year-old karaoke operator had been arrested several
times for operating karaokes illegally.
About 1,000 police cadets from schools in Gombak district, Sepang,
Klang, Kajang, Hulu Selangor, Shah Alam, Sabak Bernam, Kuala Selangor,
Kuala Langat, Ampang and Petaling Jaya took part in the parade.
The event was opened by Selangor Police Chief Datuk Mohd Noor Hamat.
Speaking to reporters later, Mohd Noor said there were 57,000 police
cadets nationwide and about 9,000 in Selangor as at last month.
He said joining the police cadet corps could prevent students from
getting involved in criminal activities.

"Protecting children from sexual abuse
Source:New Straits Times
IT is a chilling fact that sexual abuse of a child can occur anywhere,
anytime. There are many types of child sexual abuse, from inappropriate
touching, fondling, voyeurism, exposure to pornography, to full forced
intercourse and sadistic acts. Abuse may consist of a one-time incident or
be ongoing right through childhood and into the teens.
According to statistics from the Malaysian Coalition for the Prevention
of Child Sexual Abuse (MCPCSA), between 1997 and 2000, there were 5,537
reported sexual abuse cases of children in Malaysia.
The MCPCSA is an umbrella body of about 25 non-Governmental
organisations or NGOs, whose aim is to promote awareness, conduct training
and workshops focusing on child sexual abuse.
However, this is just the tip of the iceberg. To get a more accurate
picture of the situation, we must take into account the fact that child
sexual abuse is a crime which is always under-reported - mainly because
children who have been abused may be too frightened or ashamed to tell
their parents that Uncle Arif or Grandpa or Mr Thambi next door has
touched them improperly - or worse. In some cases, the child may not
consciously realise that what happened was wrong. This is especially true
in cases where the molester is a relative.
Even when they do, additional barriers may be encountered. For many of
the same reasons that children do not report abuse, their families may, in
turn, not seek help. If the family does want help, they may not know where
to go.
Unfortunately, not disclosing sexual abuse adds to the trauma for the
child and has repercussions which may last a lifetime. Sexually abused
children struggle with anxiety, fear, and issues of trust, safety, and
self-esteem. Teens may become angry, hostile, suicidal, may turn to drugs
or alcohol, act out sexually, or engage in other high-risk behaviour.
Some adult survivors seek treatment for mental illness or psychiatric
disorders which they may not realise stem from the abuse. Behaviour which
may have developed as coping mechanisms to survive the terror of the abuse
may take the form of depression, panic attacks, dissociative disorders,
substance abuse or addiction, or profound sexual dysfunction.
Parents cannot protect their children by sheltering them from the truth.
They must teach them about the dangers of sexual abuse, and prepare them
to react assertively to inappropriate touch and other signs of danger.
Lisa Edwards, a child educator and a victim of childhood sexual abuse,
says that there are a few basic principles parents must understand to
teach their children skills which can help protect them from this kind of
abuse.
The first is to tell your children that no one has the right to touch
their bodies or to do anything that makes them uncomfortable.
A good way to explain feeling ""uncomfortable"" to a child is that it is a
funny feeling inside, one that is just not right. Let them know that no
one should touch any part of their body that their bathing suit would
cover (a two-piece one for girls and swimming trunks for boys).
Most cases of abuse are perpetrated by an adult that the child knows and
trusts. It is usually a relative, family friend or another adult whom the
parents also trust. It is important that they know that if someone ever
does touch them there, then it is something you need to know about, even
if it is supposed to be a ""secret"". Reassure them that they will not be
blamed for whatever an adult does.
The second principle of abuse protection, according to Edwards, is
teaching your children about what to do if someone does touch them in a
way that makes them feel uncomfortable.
They need to be able to look that person straight in the eye and tell
him or her, ""No, I don't like that,"" and then try to get away. This shows
the abuser that the child is not going to just sit there and take the
abuse. If the person does not stop the touching after the child says no,
then the child needs to say, ""I'm going to scream if you don't stop that.""
Then the abuser would know that this is not a child to mess with.
Ask the children who they would tell if this happened to them. Help them
list all the people they could tell - parents, siblings, friends,
teachers, doctors, nurses, etc, so that someone will help them.
The third principle is role-playing, says Edwards.
Children learn by doing. The ""What if ..."" game is an important part of
teaching kids ways they can help defend themselves from harm. After
teaching them when they should speak up and how, have them ask you ""What
if ..."" questions.
Kids love to ask questions like ""What if I can't get away?"" Let them ask
as many questions as they want, and ask them to try to answer their own
questions before you help them out.
Then you can test them by giving examples of situations and asking what
they would do. You could ask, ""What if you were at the baby-sitter's
house, and she kept hugging you really tight, and it really made you feel
yucky inside?"" Then role play the situations with them over and over
again. Make sure they understand that you are pretending, and give them
big sloppy kisses and bear hugs they do not like.
Children actually love this ""What if ..."" game; they enjoy showing they
know what to do. Have them do it over and over until they get it right.
This role playing is probably the only thing that will really stay in the
minds of young children and help them in the event of someone mistreating
them. When role playing, try to incorporate the tricks abusers often use
to gain children's favour and trust.
These basic principles of abuse prevention are recommended for teaching
preschool through primary four children, but are important for children of
all ages to know. The most important rule about teaching children these
skills is to be open and honest with them, without frightening them.
We must refuse to tolerate child sexual abuse. If you think your child
or a child you know has been abused, call the police and get medical
attention and counselling for the child as soon as possible. Although
emotional or physical symptoms may not be detected, the child should see a
professional trained to work with sexual abuse victims.
In Malaysia, it is a crime punishable under the Penal Code, the Child
Protection Act 1991, the Women and Girls Protection Act 1973 and the Child
Act 2001.
The public sector and volunteer organisations have taken a leading role
in healing in cases of abuse.
Last year, the National Unity and Community Development Ministry and the
United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef) began a study on child abuse in
Malaysia.
Minister Datuk Dr Siti Zaharah Sulaiman is reported to have said that
the study incorporates both physical and sexual abuse of children and is
the first of its kind in the country.

"Boy's murder linked to sexual abuse, molestation
Source:New Straits Times
KUALA LUMPUR, Fri. - Investigations into the recent death of a teenager
may unravel a complex web of cases involving child molestation and sexual
abuse.
And the probe may even lead investigators to Fujian province in China
where they hope to find the brother of the dead boy now lying in the
Hospital Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia mortuary.
The victim would have turned 14 on Oct 23.
To date, five people, including a Datuk Seri and his bodyguard, are in
custody assisting investigations into the boy's death, classified as
murder.
The boy, initially said to have drowned, had been taken to a private
medical centre in the early hours of Sunday. He was pronounced dead on
arrival.
The body was later sent to the HUKM mortuary for a routine autopsy.
On Monday, a pathologist became suspicious when signs indicated foul
play, and alerted police.
Several arrests were made.
Now, almost a week after the death, investigators face the possibility
of exposing a racket involving children.
The police probe is expected to focus on several legal and medical
documents.
It is believed the two brothers were living  in fear for more than a
year.
Earlier, a good Samaritan had sought police assistance to look into the
horror tales related by the brothers. However, he was legally prevented
from pursuing the matter.
It is believed the elder brother had been sent back to Fujian province.
Two men and a woman in custody have undergone DNA tests.

"hree Laotian women rescued from prostitution syndicate
Source:New Straits Times
KUALA LUMPUR, Wed. - Enforcement officers rescued three Laotian women who
had been sold to a vice syndicate for US$6,000 (RM22,800) and forced into
prostitution in an operation recently.
They were later handed over to the Laos embassy, which arranged for
their return home.
Federal Territory Immigration Department chief Saadun Mat Sabari said
the operation was initiated following a request from the Laos embassy last
Thursday.
The diplomats provided the names of four Laotian women, aged between 24
and 26, they believed were being held against their will by a vice
syndicate.
The department's assistant enforcement director, Zakaria Embong,
received the request about 9am on March 27 and recalled that a Laotian
woman was in their custody after being picked up three days earlier at a
hotel in Jalan Bukit Bintang.
Having confirmed her identity, Zakaria mounted an operation to rescue
the other three women.
Seven immigration officers and three Rela members went to the hotel
about 1pm and found the three women locked in one of the rooms.
One of them was found to be three months' pregnant and another was
injured after being severely beaten for trying to escape.
""They were handed over to the embassy,"" Saadun told a Press conference
at his office in Kompleks Wilayah today.
Present were Federal Territory Immigration enforcement head Ahmad Azizan
Abdullah and deputy director Yusuf Hashim.
The four had been approached by an international human trafficking
syndicate in Laos and offered jobs in Malaysia.
They were brought into the country through Thailand about two months ago
using false documents.
""The women were sold to a local syndicate and told that they had to
sleep with 160 men each,"" Saadun said.
Fortunately, he added, one of them was picked up several days earlier.
In another operation, 16 foreign women were detained in separate actions
early today.
The first raid was carried out at a hotel in Jalan Ipoh where 13 foreign
women - eight Indonesians and five Chinese - were detained.
Ten did not have valid travel documents while the remaining three had

"Educate children on sexual abuse
Source:New Straits Times
THE police proposal to amend laws to deal with incest should be lauded.
But though it is an important step, it is not a solution. At least this
problem is now being dealt with openly. That's an important step to
dealing with this horrendous crime.
However, amending the penalty for offenders to include the death
sentence may actually be taking us two steps backward instead of a step in
front. Seth Goldstein, executive director of the Child Abuse Forensic
Institute in California and Safe-T-Child's Advisor, has written a book
entitled The Sexual Exploitation of Children - A Practical Guide to
Assessment, Investigation and Intervention, which is widely used by law
enforcement agencies. In it, Seth discusses the dynamics of child
victimisation to help investigators validate the allegations of the crime
to convict the offender.
He says an abused child commonly suffers from the ""child sexual abuse
accommodation syndrome"" whereby the child accommodates, accepts or learns
to live with the abuse. The child perceives that this reduces both
internal conflicts and conflict with the offender and helps to preserve
relationship with the family. The child has been made to feel there is no
other choice and no hope of rescue. This explains why abuse is often not
revealed for a long time, if ever. When it is, it may be viewed with great
suspicion not only because of the delayed disclosure but the unconvincing
manner of the disclosure. More often than not, the offence came to light
by a consequence of the abuse (pregnancy, injury, STD) rather than as a
voluntary disclosure by the victim.
Disclosure may be the most difficult and threatening step a victim must
take and because of real and imagined difficulties, victims won't often
come forward. There is the fear of embarrassment, fear of being
responsible or blamed, fear of being punished, fear of the court and
investigative process and also the fear that no one will believe them
especially when the abuser is a well-respected person in the community.
A well-established community study undertaken by Dr Amar Singh, a
consultant paediatrician, on the prevalence of childhood sexual abuse in
Malaysia, found that 6.8 per cent of the 616 paramedical students surveyed
admitted to having been sexually abused in their childhood. However, none
of them reported the abuse to any higher authority. It has been estimated
elsewhere that out of every case reported, three or more cases remain
undisclosed.
Let's be rational. Much as I would like to see all offenders
""terminated"", I know it will not happen, knowing the dynamics of child
abuse victimisation. The death sentence instead may be used as a further
threat to the victims not to disclose the offences. Imagine an offending
father saying to his child ""You are not going to tell on Ah Pa. I am sure
you do not want Ah Pa to die. Who is going to take care of you and the
family if Ah Pa dies?""
With the death sentence penalty, it is more likely that fewer
disclosures or reports would be made. The community would mistakenly take
pride in the ""decreasing"" cases of incest when in fact the incidence may
have increased, only not disclosed or reported.
Imagine also the flood of retraction of allegations by the child.
Without the required support from the family and the community, the child
is more likely to retract her allegations in due time especially when we
do not have a court system that deals with these issues expeditiously.
Unfortunately, most people would rather believe the retraction than the
disclosure. This leaves intact the myth that children typically lie in
claiming sexual abuse and that investigators should be suspicious and
alert for false claims. A child who has denied abuse during the
""accommodation"" phase, who makes a delayed, often impulsive disclosure and
takes it back as people get sceptical, is not an appealing or credible
witness in a criminal prosecution. This jeopardises the prosecution of
such offences. It is prudent to note that harsh sentences are useless
unless offenders are convicted.
Let's not put the cart before the horse. Our horse, a complementing
support system, should be in place first. This includes counselling,
adequately trained personnel, an expeditious court system and community
education and awareness on such issues. Leave the cart (the death penalty)
behind until we are prepared with the complementing support system. If
not, we are regressing and not advancing on our cause to fight child
sexual abuse.
We need to abandon the hope that any single law will make a difference.
It is only when we, as a concerned community, deal with these problems
proactively instead of reactively, that we will see the difference! We
should concentrate more of our resources in preventing sexual abuse from
happening in the first place instead of dealing with the offenders and the
victims after the abuse. Prevention is easy and inexpensive, recovery is
difficult if not impossible and painful.
Even our IGP, Tan Sri Rahim Noor, acknowledged that ""children were prime
targets because they had no understanding of what was happening to them.""
We seem to perpetuate sexual abuse as the ""perfect crime"" in Malaysia
because our children are vulnerable, easily persuaded to cooperate with
the abusers and quite ignorant of their right over their bodies. Another
policeman was quoted as saying that many of our children are ""sitting
ducks"" for such victimisation.
Let's take action! Let's start teaching our children about their right
over their bodies and how to keep themselves safe. Such safety education
must be a priority in our homes, our schools and our communities.
In places like New York and California, there are even legislations for
safety education to be taught to all young children in schools. Even if
our schools are not doing it, maybe in our homes and our community we can
start teaching these children. The more confident and competent children
are about keeping themselves safe, the more empowered they will be in
dealing with other challenging situations - in the classroom, in
relationship with peers, on the job and in their marriages.
The good news here is that we are giving our children skills for life.
Let's create a generation of smart kids who can deal with the kind of
challenges that are out there. As a community, we can also learn to be
""the eyes that see and ears that hear."" We can learn to identify
potentially suspected victims and offenders and take appropriate action to
deal with them.
The mass media can help to publish positive information on prevention of
such abuses, not sensationalise them. The mass media has the
responsibility to ensure that the abused child and family are not
identified. More potential victims or victims would then step forward to
get help.
Reports of sexual abuse is just a tip of the iceberg. More are
undisclosed. Victims who have been abused may start to build their
records. First, they will be truants, runaways and then they have criminal
records. If left unattended, the victim may become the victimiser in the
community. The vicious cycle continues.
Let's not wait for the politicians, the legislators and the police to
solve this problem. Together, as parents, teachers and concerned people in
the community, we can make the difference for our children. We may not be
able to change the world now but we can certainly prepare our children
TODAY!

"Man held over sexual abuse of niece
PETALING JAYA: He was supposed to watch over her while her parents were
working. Instead, a man allegedly took advantage of his position and
molested his 6-year-old niece.
The incident is believed to have occurred on Friday.
The victim's father had left his daughter at the man's house in Taman
Bukit Tinggi, Klang before going to work as there was nobody at his
Bandar Botanic home to watch the girl.
The girl's mother was also working.
""When the father went to fetch his daughter at 8pm on Friday night, she
told him that her uncle had touched her private parts,"" a source told the

""Despite her protests and refusals, the uncle continued fondling her
private parts and eventually inserted his finger.""
The father took his daughter to a nearby clinic where an examination
confirmed that her private parts were inflamed.

"Indon prostitution ring uncovered
Source:New Straits Times
KUALA LUMPUR, Wed. - The Immigration Department believes it has uncovered
an Indonesian prostitution ring with the arrest of 39 foreign women at two
karaoke outlets in Balakong and Taman Kajang Utama here last night.
In the simultaneous raids about 10pm, immigration officers also detained
12 men - eight Indonesians and four Bangladeshis - who are believed to be
the prostitutes' customers.
They also picked up four syndicate members who had been operating the
prostitution ring at the two outlets for a few months.
Speaking at a Press conference here today, Immigration Department
director-general Datuk Aseh Che Mat said: ""We uncovered the syndicate's
activities after an Indonesian woman who had been victimised by them
sought our protection recently.
""The 26-year-old widow claimed that she was forced to entertain 30 men
but did not receive any payment from the syndicate.""
He said the victim and six other women colleagues, aged from 18 to 35,
were promised jobs at local restaurants here by the syndicate members but
were instead forced into working for the prostitution ring upon arriving
here.
Based on the information given by the victim, a team of 30 Immigration
officers raided the two karaoke outlets and ""rescued"" the 39 women.
It is understood that besides entertaining local men, the prostitutes
were also taken to construction sites and industrial zones to entertain
foreign workers there.
""The Immigration Department is investigating the syndicate's modus
operandi to determine the extent of their operations,"" Aseh said.
He said the foreign women would be detained to facilitate investigations
before they are deported.
""We are also questioning the four syndicate members to find out more
about their clandestine activities.""
Aseh said the department was also considering the possibility of
revoking the temporary work permits of the 12 foreigners who were arrested
at the two karaoke outlets.
""Previously, we did not place much emphasis on pubs and karaoke outlets
as we felt that the police and local authorities were capable of enforcing
the law at such premises.
""But following last night's raids, we now intend to keep a close eye on
these entertainment spots.
""We don't want more Indonesian women to become victims of local
prostitution rings. Members of the public who have information on such
activities in their areas should inform the department immediately.""

"Bid to prove 34-month-old girl died after sexual, physical abuse
Source:New Straits Times
KUCHING, Tues. - The prosecution will prove that a 34-month-old girl died
after she was sexually and physically abused, senior federal counsel Tun
Abdul Majid Tun Hamzah told the High Court today.
He said the prosecution would adduce both circumstantial and medical
evidence as proof that Salina anak Glungan was a victim of sexual and
physical abuse before she died.
""The accused, Patrick anak Jupong, is the perpetrator,"" he said when
outlining the prosecution's case before judge Datuk Ian Chin.
The 33-year old labourer is charged with the murder of Salina between
11am and 1.30pm on March 20, 1998, at Kampung Batu Gong, Km25 Kuching-
Serian road.
Patrick is charged under Section 302 of the Penal Code which carries the
mandatory death penalty upon conviction.
Salina was Patrick's youngest sister-in-law.
Tun Abdul Majid said on the day in question Patrick left his father-in-
law's house with Salina.
When they returned home, he said Salina was unconscious.
""The deceased's sister Janet noticed Salina's left eye was blue black
and that blood was flowing from her nostrils.
""Janet then went to inform her father, Glungan anak Mongien, who was at
his padi field.
""Salina was taken to a government clinic at Siburan and later
transferred to the Sarawak General Hospital.
""Salina was pronounced dead on March 23 about 8.30pm,"" he said.
He added that a post mortem revealed that the cause of death was
bilateral subdural haemorrhage and subarachnoid haemorrhage and brain
oedema due to blunt injuries to the head.
The prosecution's first witness was chemist Lim Kong Boon, 45, of the
Chemistry Department in Petaling Jaya, Selangor.
Lim told the court that about 2.35pm on March 25, 1998, he received 12
envelopes from Inspector Aminah Ismail of Kota Samarahan police station at
his office in Petaling Jaya.
He said all the envelopes were sealed with wax seal bearing the
impression ""Ibu Pejabat Bahagian, PDRM, Kota Samarahan"".
He said Aminah also handed over to him a requisition on the exhibits
inside the envelopes.
""I was asked to examine and analyse the exhibits.""
Among the exhibits were a strand of hair taken from Salina's head, a
child's dress, a pair of dark blue shorts, a blue singlet, a specimen of
gastric contents, a bottle of colourless liquid, two specimens of blood
liquid and a specimen of semen.
Lim said he handed over the exhibits to Aminah on June 26, 1998, after
he had completed his examination and analysis.

MIRI, Thurs. - Miri police today appealed to authorities in Sarawak to
help them clamp down on prostitution.
Miri Police Chief ACP Ambrose Chung said ""extra powers"" are needed to
cleanse the town of vice, particularly prostitution.
""For instance, I would like to close down all those filthy lodging
houses in the flesh trade ... But I do not have enough powers to do so,""
he said.
If empowered, Chung said he would ""cut off power and water supplies to
the brothels.
""Unfortunately, the police do not have the power to do so. We only have
the power to raid these places ... and we do just that,"" he complained.
According to Chung, Miri Police have this year conducted some 61 raids
on brothels, resulting in the arrest and prosecution of 169 prostitutes in
Miri alone.
""But people keep putting the blame squarely on us (the police) for not
cleaning up Miri,"" he said.
Chung said the Miri Municipal Council (MMC) must assist the police in
the matter, but claimed the Council was waiting for the go-ahead from
higher authorities.
Chung also said the Miri Police emergency hotline has been abused by the
public.
He appealed to parents to advise their children to stop making prank
calls to the Emergency hotline as they could block genuine callers from
getting through.
Chung, however, said the crime rate in Miri has gone down by 18 per cent
this year.
""We have successfully reduced the crime rate, including violent and
property crimes here by 18 per cent this year, down from 1,119 last year
to just 922 so far,"" he declared.

The foreigners - five Indonesians, three Thais and three Chinese

Only one of them had a valid travel document.
The house had been renovated, with four furnished rooms on the upper

Jupong is charged under Section 302 of the Penal Code, which carries the

"Show a red card to sexual abuse
Source:New Straits Times
IS it okay or not okay to touch? Is the touch good or bad? Listen to the
voice inside you. Do what you feel is right. That was the message conveyed
to children by the Penang-based Women's Crisis Centre (WCC) during its
roadshow for primary schools in the State last month.
The month-long roadshow was part of the centre's outreach programme to
educate and create awareness about sexual abuse among 4,000 Standard Five
students in 20 schools. It included a sketch performed by the Youth
Theatre Penang entitled OK Tak OK
It was delightful to see participants' faces light up as they paid full
attention to the actors. They learnt, from the sketch, how to
differentiate between a good and bad touch and what to do in these
situations.
A teacher touching the hand of a student in class to teach her how to
count is okay. A teacher massaging a student's neck to ease a strain while
his hands stray to other parts of the student's body is not okay.
The children were also taught to identify friendly touches that border
on sexual harassment.
How?
""By listening to the voice inside you and trusting your feelings,""
Brittocia Arulanthu, 25, the centre's programme officer.
""You have a right to your body and a right to say `no' when you feel
uncomfortable with the touch,"" she added.
Child sexual abuse is the exploitation of a child for the sexual
gratification of an adult.
Sadly, adds Brittocia, family members and people close to the victims
are usually the offenders. ""The offenders are those who have authority
over the child and access to them,"" she says.
Of the 1,322 reported rapes in the country last year, 739 (56 per cent)
involved children below 16.
""We hope, through our efforts like Ok Tak OK,to reduce child sexual
abuse cases by helping them identify what is happening to them,"" she says.
The sketch, which was first staged at Convent Pulau Tikus girls' school,
presented various scenarios to get children's response.
The children were given green and red cards to signify ""okay"" and ""not
okay"".
Actors Lim Khuan Wei 25, Lim Chung Wei, 23, Mohd Kipli, 28, and Joanne
Suraya, 23, acted out various touches between children and adults.
The tale of Joe and Lena, whose uncle sexually harassed them, gave the
children a clearer picture about child sexual abuse.
When asked for solutions to Lena and Joe's problem, the Convent students
quickly responded.
One student said Lena should push away the uncle and the second
suggested that Lena tell her mother. Another said Lena should inform her
teacher and the fourth said Lena could report it to the police.
The solutions were then analysed and acted out by the performers. The
one that had Lena shoving the uncle away seemed rude. Moreover, it would
probably not stop the uncle from harassing her again.
Reporting it to Lena's mother, acted out by Joanne, was also not a
solution as she was too busy with her job and she trusted the uncle.
In the end, the best solution (given the circumstances) seemed to be
Lena telling her teacher, who later confronted Lena's mother.
Theatre director Janet Pillai said the children are unaware that their
solutions are idealistic.
""Thus, the only way to tell them that is by acting it out to show it to
them,"" she said.
The theatre group trained for half a year after months of research to
create the drama. After a preview for teachers, the drama was used as a
tool to educate students to trust their feelings and uphold their rights.
Student A. Kavita, 11, said she enjoyed herself and learnt something,
while Chin Wai Kuan and Patricia Louis, both 11, found the drama
interesting and funny.
The centre also conducted a seminar on child abuse in March for school
principals, who were shown ways to identify and counsel sexually abused
children.
It also gave teachers a kit to follow up on the programme. Classroom
activities and inter active games were recommended.
Brittocia said the WCC was seeking sponsors to help print 4,500
pictorial books for primary school students.
She says the centre also wants to reach out to parents.
The centre is a voluntary organisation established in 1985. It provides
counselling, legal advice, emotional support and temporary shelter to
women and children in crisis.
* The centre opens from Mondays to Sundays from 9am to 6pm. Counsellors
are available by appointment. Call the centre at 04-2280342.

She claimed her mother knew about her father's acts but did nothing

After silently enduring the abuse all these years, she decided to lodge
a report after he molested her again at their home in Kampung Tanjung
Kerayung, Mentakab, on Friday.
In her report lodged at the Mentakab police station, she said her
father had fondled her while she was asleep next to her mother on Friday.
Police arrested the 44-year-old lorry driver at their home on Sunday.
State CID deputy chief Superintendent K. Manoharan said the victim

"Combating child sexual abuse
Source:New Straits Times
CHILDREN often look to their parents as role models and for guidance. They
learn to communiciate, eat, bathe and walk from the two people they trust
most.
""But it is these two people who sometimes sexually abuse their children.
It is disgusting. We receive daily reports of fathers sexually abusing
their daughters and of mothers who abuse their sons,"" said Women
Development Centre (WDC) executive director Maria Chin.
WDC is a non-profit organisation set up 20 years ago that provides
training to women, teachers and children to fight physical and mental
abuse.
Since then, WDC members have successfully conducted training sessions
nationwide to educate parents and teachers on how to detect sexual abuse.
""Most abused children do not open up to others. They are, firstly,
confused because they love their parents and secondly, embarassed because
they do not want to run their parents down,"" she said after receiving a
cheque from the Nanyang Foundation at Nanyang Press in Petaling Jaya
recently.
Training sessions will be held for 50 teachers from Chinese medium
schools, and parents as well, to identify sexually abused children.
Some of the tips shared are: ""If the child suddenly becomes an introvert
or becomes quiet, this is an obvious sign of abuse.""
The intensive training sessions are supposed to educate those who are
directly involved with children.
It started last year as the committee felt concerned about the rise in
child rape and abuse.
She said they received information on a staggering number of four to
five sexually abused children daily nationwide.
The reports are from the police and Women, Family and Community
Development Ministry.
For most of the children, especially those aged four and above, the
embarrassment leaves them emotionally and mentally disturbed.
Chin said most cases were still going unreported and effective training
sessions would prepare teachers to study the behaviourial changes in a
child.
Meanwhile, Nanyang Foundation executive secretary Ann Woo, after
presenting the cheque for RM9,450, said the foundation felt strongly about
child abuse and wanted to help.
The foundation also plans to set up therapy sessions for former rape
victims to help them cope with the life-long trauma. Also present during
the cheque presentation was WDC project officer Ho Yock Lin.
The training will be held on July 17 and 18 at the Nanyang Press office.

abuse of a two-and-half-year-old girl on separate occasions in Pandamaran
and Kapar.
The two - a security guard and the victim's uncle - are being held at
the Klang police headquarters.
The guard was picked up by the police after the girl's mother lodged a
report late last month, when doctors at Tengku Ampuan Rahimah Hospital
found she had been badly beaten and sexually abused.
Yesterday, the uncle was arrested on the suspicion that he might have
sexually abused the girl as well.
Klang police chief Assistant Commissioner Karn Kam Peng said today the
victim was under the care of the hospital's welfare department, pending
police investigations.
He said the woman's husband had abandoned her and their three children a
few months ago.

"Man held in connection with armed robberies and prostitution ring
Source:New Straits Times
PETALING JAYA, Mon. - A 31-year-old man, wanted in connection with armed
robberies and a prostitution ring, was arrested at an entertainment outlet
in Taman Sea Park on Friday night.
The man, whose photofit had been pasted on all police stations in the
district, had pulled off at least three armed robberies of four-digit
outlets and escaped with RM100,000 since early this year.
He was also said to be a key member of the prostitution syndicate in the
Klang Valley. He was the middleman between the pimps and agents for
foreign women.
He has been remanded until Thursday.
Police found a pistol in his pouch. They believe he bought it from
Thailand for RM2,500 and occasionally lent it to ""friends"" to commit
robberies in return for a share of the loot.
A pair of sunglasses was also found in the pouch which police believe he
used in his robberies.
Petaling Jaya police chief Senior Assistant Commissioner (II) Datuk
Ghazali Md Amin said today policemen from the district narcotics
department were carrying out a raid on the entertainment outlet when they
spotted the man.
""When he saw the police, he tried to run but we managed to arrest him.
He was carrying a black pouch which contained the pistol, his
international passport, identity card, the pair of sunglasses, wallet and
car keys,"" he said.
Ghazali said initial investigations revealed that the suspect, married
with two children, had no previous criminal record.
""We are trying to ascertain how he brought the weapon into the country
and in what other cases the pistol was used by his friends.""

KANGAR, Mon. - A 22-year-old woman allegedly forced into prostitution for
11 days in Klang early this year informed the magistrate's court today she
had to service six clients daily.
She said she was paid RM150 for each client but the money went directly

The woman admitted she did not attempt to seek help from the police who
raided the karaoke lounge in which she was servicing her clients. She did
not try to get help from the clients either.

"Long-term impact of child sexual abuse
Source:New Straits Times
CHILD sexual abuse occurs more frequently in children from socially
deprived and disorganised family backgrounds.
This is based on research by Professor Paul E. Mullen and Dr Jillian
Fleming on the long term effects of child sexual abuse, and presented to
the National Child Protection Clearinghouse, which has been operating from
the Australian Institute of Family Studies, Melbourne, since 1995.
Marital dysfunction, such as parental separation and domestic violence,
is also associated with higher risks of abuse.
There are also increased risks of abuse with a stepfather in the family,
and when family breakdown results in institutional or foster care.
The lack of adequate care, supervision and protection also leaves a
child exposed to the approaches of molesters. A 1986 study by Finkelhor
and Baron indicates that characteristics such as physical attractiveness,
temperament or physical maturity might increase the risks of children
being sexually abused.
Girls who were socially isolated, and had few friends of their own age,
were almost twice as likely to report sexual abuse. In another study, a
link was found between a history of child sexual abuse and an earlier age
of embarking on a first co-habitation.
There is also a link between child sexual abuse and an earlier age for
the first pregnancy.
This could reflect a search for love and affection away from the
inadequate home environment, often associated with the more severe form of
child sexual abuse. A history of child sexual abuse can be associated in
adult life with insecure and disorganised attachments.
The long-term impact on the victims' mental health?
Numerous studies, say the authors, link child sexual abuse with higher
rates, in adult life, of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, substance
abuse disorders, eating disorders and post-traumatic stress disorders. A
more controversial study links child sexual abuse with multiple
personality disorders.
The authors conclude that sexually-abused children not only face an
assault on their developing sense of their sexual identity, but also a
blow to their construction of the world as a safe enough environment.
Sexual abuse also affects their developing sense of others as trustworthy.
In most cases of child sexual abuse, the fundamental damage inflicted is
to the child's developing capacities for trust, intimacy, and sexuality.
Many of the mental health problems of adult life associated with histories
of child sexual abuse are second-order effects.

"Unmask child sexual abuse
Source:New Straits Times
CHILDREN have many ways to protect themselves from sexual abuse.
Unfortunately, children, even in their teens, would not know how if they
are never coached on how to avoid sexual abuse.
At the Parent's Workshop on the Prevention and Awareness of Child Sexual
Abuse recently, parents learnt that they have a role in educating their
children, even the very little ones, about child sexual abuse.
In retrospect, parents were surprised with the extent of how little they
knew about the topic.
They learnt that children who are never told, will never report the
abuse, and since no one talks about it, not even mama or papa, they will
never have the opportunity to heal. They will suffer abnormal social
development and exhibit inappropriate sexual behaviour, even at a very
young age.
The parents were unaware that perpetrators of child sexual abuse could
be known to both the victim and the victim's parents.
They learnt how to observe certain tell-tale physical and behavioural
signs  and what they should do if they think their child has been abused.
Most importantly, they were motivated to tell everyone they knew what
they had discovered at the workshop.
Fazilah Viviana Vilarehi saw the need to tell others what she had
learnt. ""Once you know something, you don't keep it to yourself. You
spread it. Talk about it over coffee.""
In her own circle of friends, she found, that like herself, they did not
know much about child sexual abuse.
""They certainly didn't know about prevention,"" she said.
""There were many things that we didn't know and when we shared with
other parents, they were utterly surprised,"" said another parent who would
like to be known only as Zamri.
""For instance, the fact that friends can be abusers."" Now he and his
friends are more vigilant and protective over their children. They have
taught their children to recognise safe and unsafe touches, and to report
anyone who makes them feel uncomfortable in any way.
""Unless you tell them,"" Zamri said, ""they will never know (what is
inappropriate behaviour). And if they don't know, they can't tell if
something wrong is being done to them.""
He said some children go on suffering abuse for many years, right under
their parents nose.
Fazilah said if this happens, it is really the parents' fault: for not
educating their children, and for not recognising the signs.
""It is the parents' duty,"" said Fazilah, ""to protect their children. Are
you involved in your child's life, watching over them and giving advice?""
Being a foreigner she's noticed that parents here tend to be rather
laidback about their children.
""Parents leave their young children at home while they are at work. And
kids walk home alone on busy roads. You don't do that!""
Zamri is concerned about the culture in villages where people are often
too trusting and children are left at home alone. He cited an example
where a 17-year-old boy, who was supposed to look after the children in
his village was instead found molesting them.
Ronnie Leong noted from the workshop, the need for good communication
between parents and children.
""Parents tend to be so busy, with no time to spend with their children.
Children must be comfortable enough with their parents to be able to talk
to them about what happened. If there is poor communication between
parents and children, there will be no one to turn to.""
He said that a child who can conceal her pregnancy from her parents even
after eight months is indeed shocking, and speaks volumes about the
relationship between the child and her parents.
Zamri feels the need for parents to be vigilant cannot be over-
emphasised. ""Physical abuse is detectable with the naked eye - and you can
question your children. But sexual abuse cannot be detected easily.""
He said a ""kepoh"" (busybody) culture is very much needed in this
situation, whether among neighbours or relatives. Those who know of child
sexual abuse incidences should not be silent.
Fazilah blames the way our society is structured, for parents who are
too busy earning an income to have quality time with their children.
""The (modern) lifestyle is such that both parents need to work, even to
provide basic necessities."" She says society cannot expect both mothers
and fathers to work when they don't have adequate (childcare) support for
working parents.
Meanwhile, children from the Golden Kids Club who are also involved in
helping raise awareness about child sexual abuse, say that it is their
right to be protected by adults, according to the UN Convention on the
Rights of Children.
The workshop, organised by the Malaysia Coalition for the Prevention of
Child Sexual Abuse (MCPCSA) also emphasised the need for parents to teach
children as young as two ground rules.

"Maid jailed for sexual abuse of child
Source:New Straits Times
KUALA LUMPUR, Wed. - An Indonesian maid who sexually abused her employer's
three-year-old daughter was sentenced to nine months' jail by the
magistrate's court today.
Magistrate Sayani Mohd Nor ordered the sentence against Fitri Rayani
Amin Suharno, 32, a mother of two, to begin from Aug 22 last year when she
was remanded.
In imposing the sentence, Sayani said she took into consideration the
remand period of Fitri Rayani, from Medan. She was also prior to this
placed under supervision in the Indonesian Embassy here since February
last year after her employer lodged a police report.
Fitri Rayani pleaded guilty to abusing the girl in a manner likely to
cause her physical or emotional injury at a house in Taman Koperasi Polis
between November 2000 and Jan 5 last year. She had previously claimed
trial to the offence, but changed her plea when the case was mentioned
today.
The facts stated that the victim's parents had employed Fitri Rayani as
a maid to look after their daughter, who was their only child, sometime in
June 2000.
Five months later, the girl informed her parents that her private part
was hurting.
The following day, when her mother was bathing her, the victim again
complained of pain.
On Jan 5 last year, the girl once again complained to her mother of pain
in her private part and she was crying.
When her mother asked her what happened, the girl described what Fitri
Rayani did to her.
Upon examination the parents found the area to be reddish.
Following this, they questioned Fitri Rayani, but she gave an
unsatisfactory answer.
The girl's father, who is a legal officer, later lodged a police report.
The child was then referred to paediatrician Dr Sheila Marimuthu at
Hospital Kuala Lumpur who carried out a medical examination on Feb 10 last
year.
The medical report among others stated it was not possible for the child
to have injured herself.
In mitigation, lawyer V. Ravichandran, who appeared as a friend of the
court, said that Fitri Rayani, who was a first offender, repented and
regretted her action.
He said ever since the report was lodged, Fitri Rayani was placed under
supervision in the Indonesian Embassy and was remanded after being
charged.
DPP Ahmad Bache called for a deterrent sentence.

"Secrecy the hallmark of child sexual abuse cases
Source:New Straits Times
RESEARCH indicates that one in four American children have been abused
sexually. In the Philippines, the figure is close to one in three.
We have no idea how serious the problem is in Malaysia as very little
research has been done on the matter. But we can be sure of one thing,
very few of those child sexual abuse cases that are happening right under
our very noses will ever be detected or reported, says P.S. the Children
project director Madeleine Yong.
This is because secrecy is the hallmark of child sexual abuse all over
the world. Children who have been abused sexually often keep it a secret,
says Yong, because they fear rejection, blame, punishment, abandonment or
because they think people won't believe them if they speak up.
Very often, adds Yong, the abuser would have told the child that if he
tells mommy that he has been abused sexually, she is not going to want him
anymore. Or the abuser may have told the child that sex is really love so
it's okay.
""There is still a lot of denial in our society. People think that it
happens only among the lower strata of society but that's not true at all.
It cuts across all socio-economic groups. Unless society accepts and
acknowledges that the problem exists, it's going to be very difficult to
do anything about it,"" says Yong.
Studies overseas indicate that sexual abusers can be anyone of any age,
gender, or socio-economic group but the overwhelming majority are male
adults that the child knows and trusts, such as a family member, relative,
family friend, babysitter or neighbour.
When the abuser is a familiar person, repeated sexual abuse of the same
child may begin as an impulse.
Incest is a very common form of sexual abuse and occurs in all social,
economic and ethnic groups. Usually a father, stepfather or father figure
is involved but incest can also happen between mother and son or brother
and sister. Victims may range in age from infancy through the teen years.
""A mother who finds out that her husband has been abusing their child
sexually is just as much in crisis as the child. This is especially true
if the husband is the sole breadwinner in the family. Who is going to take
care of the family if he goes to jail? This is a familiar question, says
Yong.
Sometimes, because of religious beliefs, the family may feel that they
should forgive the abuser and give him the chance to repent. But this can
be quite disastrous.
""It doesn't just happen once. In the US, the average offender can abuse
up to 300 children. They know where to go. They may become camp leaders or
karate teachers to get access to children.""
A single minor incident such as exhibitionism, obscene call or fondling
may cause temporary emotional disturbances such as embarrassment, fear,
confusion, guilt, anxiety, sense of rejection, distrust of adults and
strangers. Sometimes, the child doesn't seem to be affected, but parents
should still be alert for reactions. More severe situations such as
incest, violent abuse or rape may have long-lasting effects such as:
* behavioural problems, including withdrawal, difficulty at school,
aggressive behavior and running away;
* psychological harm that can result in nightmares, extreme depression
or anxiety;
* physical harm, including cuts and bruises, venereal disease or
pregnancy.
Symptoms of emotional harm may not be evident for years, often not until
sometime in adulthood.
As such, Yong says, help should be sought for a child who has been
sexually abused even if no immediate symptoms are evident.
She cautions that children who seem to have enjoyed being sexually
abused should be given therapy to help ""reset their boundaries of right
and wrong"".
Otherwise, they could well grow up to become abusers themselves.

"Gerakan against legalising prostitution

PENANG, Thurs. - Penang Gerakan is against any move to legalise
prostitution, its secretary, Datuk Dr Teng Hock Nan, said today.
He said a proposal to this effect by Gerakan Kepala Batas division
committee member Datuk Khaw Boon Pin was strictly Khaw's personal opinion.
""Khaw's views do not reflect Penang Gerakan's stand. We are against any
move to legalise the flesh trade,"" he said in a statement today.
Dr Teng, who is also State Local Government Committee chairman, was
commenting on Khaw's suggestion that violent sex crimes could be reduced
if the Government legalised prostitution, as reported by The Malay Mail

Dr Teng said Penang Gerakan strongly believed that such crimes required
an integrated, comprehensive and concerted strategy involving all sectors
of society.
""Moreover, in formulating the strategies, the sensitivity of all
religions, moral values and practices in our multi-ethnic community must
be taken into consideration,"" he said.

legalising prostitution, as both countries had recorded low incidences of

The hotel has pledged to sell 1,200 bears in conjunction with the
""Adopt A Bear, Speak for the Children"" campaign  launched by the Protect
and Save (P.S.) The Children Association of Selangor and Kuala Lumpur last
month.
A total of 6,000 bears, retailed at RM19.90 each, are being sold by the
organiser till  end of the year.
The bears can be found at all MPH bookstores, Aseana Dorothy Perkins and
Selfridge outlets.
Launched in the presence of the tallest man in the world, Ijaz Ahmed,
who measures up to 2.54 metres (8ft 4 inches) and weighs 130kg, the 24-
year-old  did the honours by handing over three types of bears - Sid, the
blind bear; Martin, the deaf bear and Carl the mute bear - on behalf of
the association to the hotel's operations director, Vivian Chan.
Also present was the shortest man in the world, Qamar Ali.
Accompanied by the P.S. The Children assistant director Alexius Cheang,
Chan symbolically placed the three bears on three separate icing pillars
which bore the names ""Sid"", ""Martin"" and ""Carl"" at the hotel lobby last
Tuesday .
With this initiative, the hotel hopes  the Malaysian Hotels Association
would encourage its members to also adopt  the campaign and help P.S. The
Children continue to develop a support system through education and
counselling to eradicate sexual abuse of children.
Since its inception in 2002, P.S. The Children has been educating
adults and children on their rights and how to protect themselves from
sexual abuse.
""The Pan Pacific Glenmarie is the first hotel to adopt 1,200 bears. We
are trying to get more hotels to participate.
""This is to create awareness among children and adults that child sexual
abuse is not just a problem for the victim but for the entire community.
""Recent estimates gathered from various sources  indicate that as many

KUALA LUMPUR, Mon. - More sexual abuse cases are being brought to the
attention of the police and doctors who attend to abused children, but it
is strongly believed that the number of unreported cases are as many, if
not more.
A large number of cases go unreported because the child's parents or
guardians do not want the case to go to court or to avoid embarrassment or
shame.
Police data have shown a rise in cases reported. In 1996, there were 719
cases and last year, 739 cases, compared to less than 100 in 1985.
More cases are reported because the level of awareness has increased.
These were among the opinions expressed by participants of the first
session of a three-day seminar on Medical Evaluation and Treatment of
Sexually Abused Children held at the Paediatric Institute, Kuala Lumpur
Hospital, today.
The seminar is attended by doctors and other experts interested in
learning how to detect sexual abuse and to handle such abused children.
Sharing their views were Prof Dr Astrid H. Heger, director of violence
intervention programme, Centre for the Vulnerable Child in Los Angeles,
and Prof Dr Barbara L. Bonner, director of the Centre on Child Abuse and
Neglect in the Department of Paediatrics at the University of Oklahoma.
Heger said it was hard to get the child to co-operate during the
examination because for many, it meant recreating the abusive scene.
""Yet, the medical examination is an important aspect of determining
sexual abuse because in many cases, the cuts or bruises found around the
child's genitals are actually due to other reasons,"" she said.
Meanwhile, Bonner said sexual abuse, which was an international problem,
must be fully understood by the public.
Malaysian Association for the Protection of Children president Prof
Datuk Dr Mohd Sham Kasim chaired today's session.

"Legalised prostitution won't stop sexual abuse
Source:New Straits Times
I REFER to ""Gerakan against legalising prostitution"" (NST, May 21). I see
that two Gerakan politicians have two opposite views. While Datuk Khaw
Boon Pin supports legalising prostitution, Datuk Dr Teng Hock Nan
protests. Both have their reasons for their opposite stances.
I am also against legalising prostitution in Malaysia. First, there are
legal gambling outlets such as Sports Toto, a casino, etc, but some
Malaysians still go for illegal gambling on football, cockfighting, bull
fighting, etc.
Secondly, if prostitution were legalised in Malaysia, it would go
against all religions, which reject prostitution and demand that human
beings control their sexual desires.
In any case, even if prostitution were legalised, it would not stop
criminal acts related to rape and sexual abuse as there will always be
some who want to fulfil their sexual lust without paying.

"Lessons on sexual abuse for students
Source:New Straits Times
KUALA LUMPUR: Sexual predators targeting children watch out: The children
are onto your dirty tricks.
A total of 1,400 Form One students from six schools have been taught to
distinguish, among other things, between a safe and an unsafe touch and
other forms of sexual abuse.
The pilot programme, an undertaking by P.S. (Protect & Save) The
Children, is expected to be expanded nationwide over time.
P.S. The Children director Madeleine Yong said there were also plans to
introduce the programme to primary and pre-school pupils.
""We also intend to reach out to children with learning disabilities as
they are four to 10 times more vulnerable to sexual abuse than normal
children,"" she told the New Straits Times.
But the non-profit organisation's plans, sponsored by the Women, Family
and Community Development Ministry and supported by the Education
Ministry, will depend on the success of the pilot project and the
availability of funds.
Yong said the programme, which began in April, had made tremendous
headway in educating students on the dangers of sexual abuse and its many
forms.
""Some children had been abused but didn't know what was happening to
them,"" she said.
Yong said the number of children abused in Malaysia was almost similar
to the United States, where 30 per cent of children were sexually abused.
Sexual abuse of children involves visual (voyeurism), verbal (such as
obscene phone calls) or physical (including oral sex).
""From teaching personal safety and giving talks to adults, I would say
that the figures here are almost similar to the United States and the
Philippines, with half of the victims being boys,"" Yong said.
The personal safety programme is being taught at Sekolah Menengah
Kebangsaan Taman Desa, SMK Taman Connaught, SMK Seri Permaisuri, SMK
Maxwell, SMK Dharma and Victoria Institution.
On safe and unsafe touch, she said students were not specifically told
what it was.
""We don't tell them but we ask them to list out what they think it
might be. From here, we can pick out the child's experiences and from the
second lesson, gauge where they're coming from, without judging them.""
The focus was on sexual abuse, but by teaching children assertive
skills, they could learn how to say ""no"" to many other things like peer
pressure, bullying and drugs, said Yong.
Module three is on boundaries and violations.
""How do you know that your boundaries have been invaded? We give
children different scenarios so that they can identify and know what to
do if they find themselves in such a situation.""
The other modules are on how to ask for help, how to help a friend and
support networks.
""Through the programme, we hope that a better reporting system can be
established, where children will feel comfortable about reporting cases
of sexual abuse to their teachers or friends.""
The idea for the project came about after a group of teachers underwent
a training course on sexual abuse with P.S. The Children.
Victoria Institution counselling teacher Nirmala Arunasalam, who
conducts the programme at the school, said the personal safety programme
was an excellent way for students to learn to protect themselves from
sexual predators.
""In the beginning, they weren't aware of their rights but from my
observation, students later realised they could speak up.""
Nirmala added that although there was still fear, at least there was
awareness.
""When we first started, there were a few giggles, but overall they were
very responsive. The programme was very interactive and the barrier is
breaking. I feel they will be able to talk to me if there is something
wrong.""
Student Mohamad Faris Aiman Moner said the course gave him the courage
to say ""no"" to something he disliked.
""I feel more confident about myself, thanks to my teacher's guidance. I
also feel I will be able to help a friend who is being sexually abused. I
can give them options.""
His counselling teacher, Nik Norhaizan Nik Yusoff, said talking about
private parts could be uncomfortable but it became easier after several
lessons when both teacher and students were more open.
""The words we use are important. We have to control what we say because
incest involves parents and we don't want the children to become
paranoid,"" she said.
Brian J. Lariche, associate partner of project manager, The Liaison
Combination (M) Sdn Bhd, said a survey was conducted among the students
before the modules were taught.
""This is to gauge how much they know (about sexual abuse). After the
modules are taught, we will test how much they have learned.
""Three months down the road, we will test them again to see how much
they remember.""

"First step in preventing child sexual abuse starts at home
Source:New Straits Times
KAJANG, Thurs. - The first step towards the prevention of child sexual
abuse lies at home, concluded a seminar on Prevention of Child Sexual
Abuse in Kajang today.
Chief Inspector Kamariah Jamaludin of the Kajang police special crimes
section said that parents and guardians had the duty to inform their
children what sex abuse was all about.
""This is their responsibility,"" she said. ""The child must be aware of
this and how it concerns him or her.""

had the responsibility, under the law, to report cases of child sex abuse
to the authorities.
The seminar, attended by 22 people, was organised by the Eagles Nest
Computer and Community Centre and Kajang police. It was conducted by the
Women's Development Collective.
At the seminar were teacher-counsellors from Kajang, officers and
members from Rumah Faith and Eagles Nest Computer and Community Centre,

"Concern over handling of alleged child sexual abuse case
Source:New Straits Times
PENANG, Fri. - The Penang Women's Crisis Centre today voiced concern over
the handling of a recent incident of child sexual abuse, by school
In the particular case, the only action taken by the parents of a five-
year-old girl after she was allegedly molested by her school bus driver,
was to have her transferred to another kindergarten.
""Child sexual abuse must not be taken lightly and the perpetrator should
be punished according to the law,"" said WCC executive director Loh Cheng
Kooi in a press statement today.
In the incident on Feb 24, the school bus driver in Johor Baru had
allegedly molested the girl whom he was transporting to and from
kindergarten.
He was alleged to have brought the girl to a playground, sat her on his
lap and molested the girl who later complained to her parents of pain in
her private parts. However, upon being told of the incident, the parents
had her transferred out of the school, after approaching the principal and
teacher, and leaving it to them to take action.
""Molesting a child is a crime under Malaysian law and a molester may be
punished with imprisonment for a term of up to 10 years, a fine and/or
whipping.""
""On the other hand, a molester whose actions are treated lightly may
assume that it is not serious and can go on molesting other children,"" she
said.
""The parents should have reported the matter to the relevant authorities
or sought the help of the State Welfare Department so that action could be
taken to stop further abuse.""
WCC urged the School Bus Association of Johor Baru to conduct an
investigation into the incident as it was of concern to parents who are
dependent on their services.
""School bus drivers' credibility is at stake and they should uphold the
parents trust in commuting the children to and from school,"" Loh said.
She also said the alleged driver's service must be suspended pending
police investigation.
Since 1977, WCC had been working with the State Education Department to
highlight the issue of child abuse throughout the schools in Penang.
WCC is currently preparing an information kit for teachers on the issue
of child sexual abuse to enable them to understand and teach the children
to protect themselves from sexual abuse.
Loh advised anyone who knows of any incident of child abuse to
immediately report to the police and have the child taken to the State or
district hospital for a medical examination.

"Junior athlete tells court about sexual abuse by former national coach
Source:New Straits Times
KUALA LUMPUR, Mon. - A former junior athlete told the High Court today
that she was sexually abused by former national athletics coach C.
Ramanathan under the pretext of massaging her injured legs in 1992.
The 21-year-old, now a bank clerk, said Ramanathan massaged her buttocks
and fondled her breasts when she went to his room for the massage.
She said she was undergoing centralised training with other athletes for
a championship and that Ramanathan was her coach.
She was giving evidence in a defamation suit by Ramanathan against the
editor of the Malay Mail and its publisher, the New Straits Times Press
(M) Bhd, for allegedly publishing an article defaming him.
Ramanathan is claiming that the article on March 8, 1994, titled
""Athlete lodges report - coach fondled breasts under pretext of massage""
had meant that he was a sexual deviant and was guilty of outraging the
modesty of the athlete.
He is seeking damages with interest and costs.
The defendants are claiming that the article was not defamatory, adding
that it was only fair comment and justified.
To a question by the defendants' counsel Pawan Cheek Marican, the woman
said she had complained to Ramanathan earlier that day of pains in her
legs.
""He said he would give me a massage later in the night. I did not ask
him to massage me. I told him about the pain hoping that he would let me
rest for a day or two,"" she said.
She added when she went to Ramanathan's room later that night, he asked
her to change into a pair of shorts from the track suit she was wearing.
""He asked me to lie on the bed and applied baby oil on my legs. Then his
hands touched and caressed my buttocks and my back.
""His hands went under my tee-shirt and he unhooked my bra. I asked him
why he did that but he told me to keep quiet,"" she said.
She said Ramanthan told her not to tell anyone about the massage.
The girl said she told chaperone Dharmika Chua about the incident few
days later.
Cross-examined by Karpal Singh, for Ramanathan, the girl said she had
not lodged a police report in 1992 as she had informed Chua of the
incident.
She said she only lodged a report in 1994 to support a statement by Chua
which appeared in the Malay Mail.
Hearing continues before judge Datuk R.K. Nathan on Aug 20.

""After that, a man, whom we know as Whisky, picked up us and brought us

"Probe into sexual abuse claims at welfare home
Source:New Straits Times
JOHOR BARU, Fri. - The Johor Welfare Department has launched an internal
investigation into allegations that one of its senior officers in charge
of an all-women's welfare home had sexually molested several inmates.
State Welfare director Mohd Kodri Omar said today that at least two
mentally-disabled inmates of the Rumah Taman Sinar Harapan in Jalan Datin
Halimah had reported that they had been fondled and molested by the man in
his office on several occasions.
The officer has been temporarily seconded to the department's
headquarters, pending the completion of the investigation.
Kodri said the investigation into the allegations was headed by his
deputy, Haron Mohd Isa, adding that a team would also question other
inmates to ascertain if there were more allegations of sexual abuse.
The New Straits Times has learnt that the allegations came to light
after the two inmates had complained to a staff at the home, early this
month.
Recently, the home's Visitor's Board held a special meeting to discuss
the allegations of sexual abuse.
Rumah Taman Sinar Harapan was set up in the 1950s by the Federal
Government.
It has today more than 250 female inmates housed in about 20
dormitories.
It houses physically and mentally-handicapped girls and women who have
been abandoned by their families.
It also houses normal babies, children and teenagers, including orphans,
the children of illegal immigrants and divorced parents.
The home also takes in children whose parents are serving prison
sentences.
Asked why a male warden was in charge of an all-female institution,
Kodri said that there was no specific policy stating that the position had
to be held by a woman.
""The idea is probably that the girls would benefit from having a father
figure in their lives,"" he added.
Kodri said that the department had not lodged a police report or sent
the alleged victims for a medical examination because it had not completed
its investigation of the case.
He added, however, that the investigations should be completed soon.
In a related development, State Unity, Women's Affairs and Social
Welfare Commitee chairman Halimah Sadique has promised a thorough
investigation into the allegations of sexual abuse and that there would be
no cover-up.
""If the allegations are found to be true, the officer concerned will be
brought to book,"" Halimah added.

"Alarm about child sexual abuse
Source:New Straits Times
KUALA LUMPUR, Sat. - One in four Malaysian children is sexually abused,
say non-governmental organisations here.
""The number is extremely large,"" said Sabri Abdul Rahman, chairman of
the Malaysian Coalition for the Prevention of Child Sexual Abuse.
""Ignoring these figures will lead to an increase in abuse, if the public
is insensitive to situations around them.""
Sabri said it was imperative that the public be vigilant and report
cases of suspected sexual abuse to the authorities.
The figure was obtained from estimates gathered from NGOs and government
bodies.
Surveys conducted by P.S. The Children, an NGO dealing with child sexual
abuse, confirm the figure.
Police statistics indicate that there were 306 cases of incest in 2002
compared with 254 last year. At least half the victims were below 16.
Last year, 72 of the offences were committed by the victims' fathers.
Other perpetrators were uncles, stepfathers, cousins and stepbrothers.
But NGOs insist that reported cases are only the tip of the iceberg.
""The reason for the low reported numbers is because of the secrecy
involved in child sexual abuse,"" said Alexius Cheang, assistant director
of P.S. The Children Association for Selangor and Kuala Lumpur.
""Eighty to 90 per cent of offenders are known to the victims and the
victims do not want the burden of guilt of sending someone they love to be
punished. They just want the abuse to stop.""
Chen Lee Ping, a social worker and a services co-ordinator for the All
Women's Action Society, said: ""What goes unrealised is that most child
abuse victims will not report it because they love the sex offender
because he gives them attention and has built up a strong relationship of
trust. This is why more often than not the sex offender is someone they
know.
Women, Family and Community Development Minister Datuk Seri Shahrizat
Abdul Jalil said the statistics were worrying.
Shahrizat said the Government had planned to set up support groups to
assist incest victims and their families, and she planned to meet doctors,
academicians and NGO representatives to consider various possibilities,
including smart partnerships with NGOs and private-sector operators
working against child sexual abuse.

"Educating students on child sexual abuse
Source:New Straits Times
LATELY, the country has been disturbed with reports of sexual abuse cases
against women, especially those below 18 years old.
Almost everyday, reports on rape, incest and murder are highlighted in
the newspapers and flashed on  television.
Following this, Projek Lintasan Kota Sdn Bhd (Prolintas), which is the
concessionaire of the Kuala Lumpur-Ampang Elevated Highway, has embarked
on a programme to educate the community, especially  children and
teenagers, on sexual abuse.
With the co-operation of the Malaysian Crime Prevention Foundation
(MCPF) and the police, Prolintas is organising a talk on ""Child Sexual
Abuse"" at five schools located along the highway.
The schools are Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Hulu Kelang, Sekolah
Menengah Kebangsaan Puteri Ampang, Sekolah Rendah Kebangsaan Datuk Keramat
2, Sekolah Rendah Kebangsaan Jalan Gurney 1 and Sekolah Rendah Kebangsaan
Jalan Gurney 2.
The programme was launched by MCPF vice-president Tan Sri Lee Lam Thye
at SMK Hulu Kelang in Ampang recently.
Also present were Prolintas chief executive officer Zainudin A. Kadir,
school principal Normah Omar and ASP Nor Azilah Jonit who is the head of
the Children Protection Unit of the Sexual Crime Investigation Division,
under the Crime Investigation Department of Bukit Aman police
headquarters.
Zainudin said the talk was organised to educate the children and
teenagers on sexual crimes.
It was also aimed at teaching them to avoid becoming victims of  such
crimes.
""As a responsible corporate citizen, our company is committed to
organise such a programme following the recent surge of sexual crimes,"" he
said.
He added Prolintas would continue to play its role in combating crimes
involving children and teenagers.
""It is also one of our ways to say `thank you' to the community for
supporting us,"" Zainudin said.
After the talk, Prolintas will continue to work with the schools on
identifying and eliminating potential sexual crime spots around the school
areas, he said.
Lee applauded Prolintas's effort in educating the young on sexual abuse.
He said the talk would help them better understand  sexual offences and
how to protect themselves.
He said the number of cases on sexual offences against children and
teenagers were on the rise.
According to police  statistics, there were 581 rape cases reported
between January and April alone
""The root of this problem can be seen from a lot of angles.
""One of them being the lack of noble values among today's generation,""
said Lee.
He said efforts should be made by all parties to re-inculcate such
values, especially respect among the younger generation.
He added that society should not let the police fight the crimes alone.
""All parties including non-governmental organisations, society and
schools should contribute towards the effort.""

"Children need more educating on sexual abuse
Source:New Straits Times
THE staggering figure of 700 reported child rape cases in the country
(NST, March 27) for last year alone shrivels the imagination and breaks
the heart, especially as these acts were perpetrated by people closely
related to the victims, such as father, stepfather, brother, cousin, uncle
and even grandfather.
This number obviously only represents the reported cases where the
victims' relatives had the courage to make the reports. Many other
incidents may have gone unreported, with relatives shying away from the
resultant publicity to spare the victims a life-long ignominy.
Rape cases generally are on the increase and people have cried foul over
the inadequate safeguards under the existing laws. While it is
understandable that very young victims are powerless to repulse the sexual
advances of their guardians, it is incomprehensible that young girls
should literally be taken for a ride and be raped.
How can they be so naive as to accept free rides and drinks from total
strangers and not read the warning signs, either in spoken word or body
language?
Don't parents consider it their duty, however illiterate they may be, to
warn their children of the dangers? While gallivanting or lepak is part of
the culture of youngsters, they should be aware of the danger inherent in
a seemingly innocent outstretched hand.
There are a lot of NGOs to safeguard the interests of women. We also
have newly-created Puteri wings of various political parties. They should
take special care to highlight this particular menace which threatens to
overtake all other crimes. In a situation like this nothing can match
proper education.

Entertainment continued with blues singer Julian Mokhtar who performed a
string of jazz numbers.
Association president Madaleine Yong said proceeds from the auction
would be used to educate and help prevent sexual abuse among children as
well as to provide psychological support to the young victims.
""Sexual abuse, especially towards children, is still considered a taboo
and people do not talk about such matters. That is why for every reported
case, another 10 go unreported,"" she said.
Child sexual abuse includes inserting objects or body parts inside the
vagina, mouth or anus of a child, touching and fondling of private parts,
showing pornography, obscene telephone calls, rape, oral sex, sodomy,
prostitution and voyeurism.
The effects on the victims, said Yong, ranged from nightmares to sudden
mood swings, fear of people and places, bedwetting, socialising problems,
self mutilation and suicidal tendencies.
The association is looking for volunteers to assist the victims.

track down these suspects as well as to beef up security measures in the State

KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 3 (Bernama) -- Public Bank Berhad claimed that there
were more than adequate security systems in place at its branch in Seri
Kembangan, Selangor, which was broken into by robbers last year.
The robbery was perpetrated by highly skilled professionals who
succeeded despite the bank's adequate security systems, it said in its
statement of defence in a suit brought by a customer whose safe-deposit box
was among 93 which were broken into.
The bank denied that the losses were caused by the bank's own action,
omission and negligence as contended by Wong Lee Hal, 43, an administrative
officer who is seeking special damages, general damages based on market
gold prices, aggravated damages for the loss of valuables kept in the box,
costs and other reliefs deemed fit by the court.
In her statement of claim, Wong claimed that she kept the jewellery
included her wedding ring and a bracelet, a gold chain, a jade bangle,
precious stones, earrings and cash, all worth about RM200,000 in the
safe-deposit box in the belief it was the safest place.
The case came up for case management today before Judicial Commissioner
Mohd Yazid Mustafa who fixed April 28 next year for further mention.
In the statement of defence filed in January this year, Public Bank
also said that Wong was bound by the bank's terms and conditions contained
in the agreement which she entered into with the bank on Jan 12 last year
for hire of safe-deposit box.
Among others, the agreement envisaged that Wong was to take
responsibility to insure and safeguard herself against losses as the bank
did not have knowlege of the contents and value of the items placed in the
box, it said.
The bank claimed that it was merely letting out the box as a service to
its customers and asked the court to dismiss the suit.

PUTRAJAYA, July 5 (Bernama) -- The Court of Appeal here today upheld a
High Court order for a retrial of an armed robbery involving two unemployed men
in 2004.
Justices Datuk Hasan Lah, Datuk Ahmad Maarop and Datuk Sulaiman Daud
unanimously dismissed the prosecution's appeal to set aside the Muar High
Court's decision that they were unfairly tried.
The retrial of S. Murthu, 33, and V. Veerakumar, 28, at the Muar Sessions
Court is scheduled for Wednesday.
They were charged with a third person, A. Sarawanan, and sentenced to jail
for committing armed robbery on five Nepalese nationals of cash and valuables
worth RM2,500 at a house in Batu 7, Jalan Bakri, Muar, Johor at 2.20am
on June 6, 2004.
Sarawanan was sentenced to 12 years' jail and ordered to be given eight
strokes of the cane, while the other two were each given nine years' jail and
also eight strokes of whipping.
On July 24, 2008, the High Court allowed appeals by Murthu and Veerakumar
for a retruial but struck out Sarawanan's bid because he absconded.
The original trial of the three commenced on June 16, 2004 and they were
asked to make their defence on April 27, 2007.
On May 2007, the trio asked the Sessions Court for a month's time to get a
new lawyer as their previous one had discharged himself.
Sessions Court Judge Norazlan Ahmad allowed their request but stated the
trial would proceed even if they failed to appoint a lawyer.
On June 21, 2007, their new lawyer was not present in court and an
adjournment was refused and the judge noted that as of 10.45am, no faxed message
was received from the new laywer.
The trial resumed and all three were found guilty and convicted.
In the proceedings today, lawyer Gobind Singh Deo representing Murthu and
Veerakumar, submitted that a search in the court file revealed that the counsel
did fax to the court the request for an adjournment or a stand down.
He said it was a blatant abuse of discretion by the Sessions Court judge.

who is the proprietor of Kedai Emas Chitra Jewellers at Jalan Lahat, Ipoh,
their Indonesian maid and a security guard.

collector, G. Krishna Rao, 28, to death after finding him guilty of killing
the four people after he opted to remain silent when he was ordered to make
his defence.
The duo were found guilty of killing S. Veeramah, 48, her son Sathian,
their maid Sariyah at a house in Taman Seri Dermawan, Ipoh, Perak, and
security guard M. Balakrishnan at Malligah Jewellers in Jalan Lahat, Ipoh.
The four killings took place between 6.30pm on March 12 1998 and

the estate.

money in two Automatic Teller Machines (ATM) at a bank in Jalan Pejabat
here early this morning using excavators, gave up when the excavator arm
became stuck to the ceiling of the bank.
The duo, who tried to use the same tactic as the robbers who struck in

excavator, causing them to bolt after failing in their attempt, leaving the
excavator behind.
Terengganu Chief Police Officer, SAC I Acryl Sani Abdullah Sani, said
the botched attempt was believed to have happened between 4.45am and 5.30am
and that the robbers had intended to pry loose the 24-hour ATM machines at
the EON Bank.
The incident was discovered by a police patrol at about 6.30am, he
said.

site about 100 meters from the bank.

pulling the ATM out,"" he told a press conference at the Kuala Terengganu

On Aug 9, three robbers tried to escape with an ATM from a bank in

"NO PACT BY TWO MEN TO COMMIT ROBBERY-CUM-MURDER, COURT TOLD
Court-Murder
PUTRAJAYA, Jan 17 (Bernama) -- A lawyer told the Court of Appeal today
there is no evidence of any pact by two men to rob a jeweller and murder
four people, for which they have been sentenced to death by the Ipoh High
Court eight years ago.
V. Rajadevan said there is no evidence to show that his client and
first appellant G. Krishna Rao had worked with second appellant M.
Rajendran with the common intention of committing the robbery and the
murders.
He submitted that the reasons advanced by the High Court Judge to
support the finding of a common intention are purely speculative and not
substantiated by the evidence at the close of the prosecution's case.
Debt collector Krishna Rao, 28, and former policeman Rajendran, 39, are
appealing against their conviction and death sentence imposed by the Ipoh
High Court.
Both men were sentenced to death in 1999 for the murder of goldsmith P.
Nailliah's wife S. Veeramah, 48, their son Sathian, their Indonesian maid
Sariyah and a security guard M. Balakrishnan at Malligah Jewellers in Jalan
Lahat, Ipoh, between March 12 and 13 1998. Nailliah is the proprietor of
Kedai Emas Chitra Jewellers in Jalan Lahat, Ipoh.
Krishna Rao was sentenced on Aug 4 1999 after he opted to remain silent
when ordered to make his defence at the end of the prosecution's case.
Rajendran was sentenced on Aug 13 of that year after he was found guilty at
the end of the defence case.
Another accused, K. Kumaresan, 31, was acquitted of the murders on July
27 1999 after the High Court Judge Datuk Kang Hwee Gee found insufficient
evidence to link him to the crime.
Krishna Rao was the person who gave the information that led to the
recovery of Balakrishnan's body in a ravine at Km292.4 of the North-South
Expressway while Rajendran led police to the recovery of the stolen
jewellery from Chitra Jewellers.
The appeal is being heard before a three-man bench presided by Justice
Datuk Gopal Sri Ram together with Justice Datuk Zulkefli Ahmad Makinudin
and Justice Datuk Md Raus Shariff.
Counsel Rajadevan also submitted that Krishna Rao was not informed the
consequences of his remaining silent at the time and that the court would
have no option but to convict him.
He said Krishna Rao's case should be sent back to the Ipoh High Court
for him to enter his defence so that the court can evaluate his evidence.
Rajendran's lawyer Malik Imtiaz Sarwar submitted that there is no
direct evidence to show that Rajendran was at the scene of the murders,
which was the house.
""In this case, there is nothing to link Rajendran to the murders. The
murder weapon or weapons were not determined. As such, there is no basis to
say that Rajendran had been an active participant in the murder,"" he said.
Malik added that there was no forensic evidence to show that Rajendran
was at the scene.
He said that from Rajendran's evidence, he admitted to having taken
some of the jewellery and he was the person who gave the information that
led to the recovery of the jewellery in Ulu Kinta.
The hearing continues tomorrow for Deputy Public Prosecutor Noorin
Badaruddin to submit for the prosecution.

"DEVA GANG MEMBER CHARGED WITH RM2 MLN ROBBERY AT UM
Court-Deva
KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 17 (Bernama) -- A handphone seller believed to be a
member of the notorious ""Deva Gang"" was charged in the Sessions Court here
today with robbing a security guard of RM2,190,000 at Universiti Malaya on
Chinese New Year eve on Jan 28.
Tham Mao Hsiung, 36, from Padang Besar, Perlis, claimed trial to the
first charge of having knowledge that his accomplice at Kompleks Perdana
Siswa, Universiti Malaya, was having a firearm illegally at about 1.40pm on
the day of the robbery.
Tham also claimed trial to the second charge of him and three other
men, still at large, had robbed a security guard Mohd Firdaush Daud, 25, of
Safeguard Securicor Sdn Bhd, at the same time and place as in the first
charge.
Police arrested Tham in Padang Besar on Feb 5 after receiving a tip-off
that he was planning to flee the country via the border.
It was reported that the gang staged the robbery while four security
guards were loading money into the automatic teller machine (ATM) at the
UM.
Tham's counsel Ranjit Singh Dhillon made a verbal application to the
court not to detain his client at the Sungai Buloh Prison but instead at
the Alor Star Prison.
He gave two reasons why his client should not be sent to the Sungai
Buloh Prison pending hearing of the case.
He claimed wide media coverage on his client's arrest had jeopardised
Tham's safety while under detention.
""My client has been cooperating with police on this case and Deva Gang
members who are mostly based in the Klang Valley may attempt to use their
links to harm Tham,"" he said.
Ranjit said Tham's 65-year-old mother, a diabetic with heart
complications, had asked him to appeal to the court to use its discretion
on humanitarian grounds to allow her son to be detained at the Alor Star
Prison which is nearer for her to visit.
Objecting to the application, DPP Ku Hayati Ku Haron pointed out that
it would be costly for the authorities to produce Tham in court for trial
each time, besides the security reasons of having to travel such a long
journey if the court allowed Tham to be detained in Alor Star.
Judge Nursinah Adzmi agreed with Ku Hayati and ordered Tham to be
detained at the Sungai Buloh Prison and fixed hearing for three days
beginning July 17.

"WAREHOUSE ROBBERY: TWO CONTAINERS OF MICROCHIPS STOLEN
Robbery-Microchip
PENANG, Nov 20 (Bernama) -- Twenty men, including four dressed in Rela
uniform, broke into a warehouse at the MAS Air Cargo Complex in Batu Maung
near here early this morning and drove away with two containers of computer
parts and chips worth millions of ringgit.
State police chief Datuk Koh Hung Sun said in the 2.30 am incident, the
robbers disguised in Rela uniforms entered the warehouse premises on the
pretext of carrying out an operation while their accomplices had hid in the
lorries they came in.
Armed with machetes, they held up the people on duty there before
carting out the goods, he said.
Koh said preliminary investigations found that the suspects, aged
between 20 and 40 years, also ran away with the closed-circuit television
cameras installed at the cargo area.
He said the police were still investigating all aspects of the robbery
including their modus operandi and how they broke into the area.
""We have set up a special task force to investigate this case,"" he told
a press conference here today.
Koh also said that two Custom officers and two Malaysia Airports Berhad
(MAB) staff as well as 13 warehouse workers who were on duty at that time
suffered minor injuries due to beatings from the robbers.
All of them were also believed to have been forced to swallow a fluid
which caused them to throw up.
The victims were later treated at the Penang Hospital and a private
hospital.
The supervisor of a delivery company, who was at the cargo area when
the incident happened, said one of his co-workers was injured in the
robbery.
""According to the worker, he and six of his friends arrived at the
complex in the company van. While waiting for the Customs to open the gate,
two of the suspects appeared from nowhere and attacked them with machetes,""
the supervisor said.
The complex is under the supervision of MAS Kargo and MAB.
Meanwhile, Penang Chief Minister Tan Sri Dr Koh Tsu Koon asked MAS
Kargo to investigate its security system in the area, and hoped the police
would bring to book the culprits fast.
""I am regret this incident happened as it indirectly affects Penang's
image in particular and Malaysia's in general,"" he told a press conference
after visiting the crime scene today.
He said that Prime Minister Datuk Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi had been
informed of the robbery, and the latter wanted the police to immediately
investigate the crime.
Dr Koh said there were also economic implications due to the robbery as
the owners of the goods had suffered losses, while the bigger impact would
be the investors' confidence on the state's security level.
Police picked two suspects in connection with the case later in the
evening.

Court-Suit
KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 20 (Bernama) -- The widow of a despatch rider who was
fatally shot while on his way to a bank to deposit cash belonging to MBF
Holdings is suing the company for negligence and claiming RM1.6 million in
damages.
K. Indra, 30, filed the suit through counsel, P. Uthayakumar, at the
Sessions Court's registry here today.
She named MBF Holdings Berhad and MBF Cards Sdn Bhd as the defendants,
whom she claimed had failed and were negligent in providing protection and
ensuring the safety of her husband, R. Nagarajan, at work.
She also claimed that the defendants had failed to take the necesary
measures to save her husband, who suffered serious injuries, and had
allowed him to be in pain and bleed profusely for about half-an-hour before
the police arrived at the scene and sent him to the hospital.
In her claims, Indra said the respondents had employed her husband as a
despatch rider in Johor Baharu since 1992 until March 2, 2006, the day he
was shot by robbers while on the job.
She claimed that according to the terms of Nagarajan's employment, he
could not be ordered to carry or handle cash as well as deposit the money
into banks.
However, on March 2, 2006, she said, one of the defendants had
instructed her husband to deposit RM200,000 into an account at a branch of
RHB Bank here.
Indra claimed that her husband was forced to do the job as instructed
and was accompanied by another employee of the defendant, Rashid Tompong,
to the bank.
She claimed that her husband left the office to the bank on a
motorcycle and had stopped the machine at the side of a road divider as
instructed by Rashid.
Nagarajan was walking to the bank when he was approached by a robber
who then shot him in the abdomen.
Besides claiming RM1,599,121.20 in damages, Indra is also seeking
general and special damages, interests, costs and other reliefs deemed fit

"AUSSIE MAGISTRATE DOES NOT BUY KL KNIFEPOINT ROBBERY STORY
AUSSIE-CLAIM
MELBOURNE, March 23 (Bernama) -- A Diners Club Australia member has been
ordered to pay a A$16,000 debt for jewellery he claimed he was forced to buy at
knifepoint by a gang of four kidnappers in Kuala Lumpur.
Richard James Stocks, 35, detailed an ordeal that started last year in Kuala
Lumpur with his kerbside abduction and ended in losing a courtroom fight to
deny liability, The Age newspaper reported.
The IT consultant told the Melbourne Magistrate's Court that he was driven
to various shopping centres in KL over seven hours by his captors on Feb 24,
who ""used me as a tool"" to make or attempt purchases worth more than A$37,000.
His lawyer, Geoff Block, said Stocks' main concern was ""the preservation of
life and limb"" while on a business trip.
""To achieve this, he had to comply with his captors' demands,"" Block said.
The newspaper said Stocks denied Diners Club counsel Mark Purvis' suggestion
that the woman captured on CCTV footage with him at the stores was a ""female
acquaintance"" he was shopping with.
He also denied Purvis' proposition that he had earlier been ""placed in a
compromising position"" and then blackmailed to buy the jewellery but needed a
story to tell his wife if she found out.
Stocks also disagreed with Purvis who suggested he had been a ""willing
participant"" in the transactions but needed an explanation for his family,
friends and employer why the items appeared on his Diners Club statement.
The court heard two transactions attempted by Stocks that day were declined
before Diners Club allowed one for A$16,493, the newspaper said.
Stocks said he was robbed of his camera and accessories, an electronic game
and a mobile phone - but not his wallet or a second phone - and was also forced
to withdraw about A$700 from an ATM.
He said he had no recollection of buying or signing for the jewellery until
told by Diners Club.
In finding for Diners Club, magistrate Peter Lauritsen described as
""pathetic"" Stocks' report to police and his behaviour as so bizarre that ""I
cannot accept that it's truthful"".
Stocks was ordered to pay $16,493 to Diners Club and a total of $9,882 in
interest and costs.

"COUPLE FREED OF TV3 CAMERA ROBBERY CHARGES
COURT-AFRICAN
KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 23 (Bernama) -- The Sessions Court here today acquitted
and discharged a couple on two counts of robbing two cameras owned by television
station TV3 from its cameramen two years ago.
Judge Zainal Abidin Kamarudin made the decision in the case of African
restaurant owners Elizabeth Sumana De Silva, 44, and her Nigerian husband
Adeyemi Rasaq Tunde, 44, after finding that the defence had raised a
reasonable doubt in the prosecution's case.
""This clearly shows that justice does not look at skin colour,"" he told
the couple after delivering the judgement.
For the first amended charge, De Silva, a Malaysian of Portuguese descent,
was alleged to have been in possession of a Panasonic DVX 102B robbed from
33-year-old Fauzi Muin. She was charged under Section 412 of the Penal Code
which carries a jail sentence of up to 20 years and fine, upon conviction.
On the second charge, De Silva was said to have been with 10 others, who are
at large, when robbing a Panasonic DVC PRO in the care of Nor Azman Jumahat, 36,
under Section 395 of the Penal Code, which carries a jail sentence of up to 20
years or caning, upon conviction.
Adeyemi was alleged to have been with about 20 people who are at large when
they robbed a Panasonic DVX 102B camera in the care of Fauzi Muin, 33, which
under Section 395 of the Penal Code carries a prison sentence of up to 20 years
and caning.
The offences were said to have been committed at Jalan Menara Gading 1,
Taman Connaught, Cheras, here, at 1.10 am on Sept 15, 2008.
Zainal Abidin, in his judgement, said that on the first charge faced by De
Silva, the court was told that the camera was kept by her as proof for the
police.
""In her statement under oath, the accused said she contacted the police to
inform them she was keeping the camera,"" he said.
On the second charge faced by De Silva, Zainal Abidin said the accused in
her statement had denied robbing the camera and this was supported by defence
witnesses who were customers of the restaurant.
""A statement from a customer known by the accused affirmed that he and De
Silva were present during the chaos, but he did not see the accused take
anything during or after the incident,"" he said.
Besides that, according to the witness who was well-versed on cameras, it
was unlikely that a woman could easily pick up the seven kg camera which was
usually set on a tripod, he said.
The judge said that on the charge against Adeyemi, the accused did not have
the intention of robbing the camera.
""The camera was actually taken as a precautionary measure because the
restaurant had been vandalised by gangsters in April 2008,"" he added.
Deputy Public Prosecutor Nurul Asyiqin Zulkifli appeared for the prosecution

"UNDERAGE BOY GETS JAIL FOR CAUSING DEATH, ROBBERY
Court-Juvenile
KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 25 (Bernama) -- The Sessions Court here today
sentenced an underage boy to five years' jail for causing the death of a
nightclub employee and four years for robbing the same woman.
Judge Nursinah Adzmi ordered the jail terms to run concurrently from
the day the boy was arrested on March 24, 2006.
The 17-year-old boy from Gemas, Negeri Sembilan, had pleaded guilty to
robbing Lie Wan Nie, 31, of her handbag containing RM10.14, a wristwatch,
set of keys and umbrella in front Kafe Tinder Box Pub at the Cheras
Business Centre here at 2.30am on March 23 last year.
He also admitted injuring and causing her death.
According to the facts of the case, the accused admitted having planned
the robbery by way of snatching with an accomplice and had ridden a
motorcycle to the scene at 2am on that day.
The victim, at the time, had just finished work and was waiting for her
boy friend to take her home. The accused admitted having approached the
victim and snatched her handbag before stabbing her with a seven-inch
knife.
Loke Scheau Lun who witnessed the incident gave chase with his car and
hit the motorcycle ridden by the accused. The accused fell and ran away.
The victim was pronounced dead at 2.40am at the Pantai Cheras Hospital.
The next day, police arrested the accused who was hiding at a house in
Taman Dagang, Ampang.
Deputy Public Prosecutor Mohamad Abazafree Mohd Abbas said the court
should view the offences as serious as police statistics showed that armed
robberies were on the increase annually.
A total of 13,537 cases were reported last year and 13,210 cases in
2005, he said.
""The offences which started with a robbery and snatch-theft, ended with
a tragedy - the victim's death. The crime is serious and the most
appropriate penalty is jail,"" he said.
He said that although the accused was a juvenile, Section 91 of the
Child Act 2001 allowed an accused above 14 years of age to be committed to
jail after being found guilty of an offence.
Defence counsel Leong Yeen San had requested for the accused to be sent
to a correctional school, instead.
Judge Nursinah agreed with Mohamad Abazafree that the offences were
serious.
The fact that the accused was 16 when he committed the crime, could not
override the facts of the case and the offences committed, she said.
In sending the accused to jail, she said that he should not be allowed
to mix with adult prisoners as provided under Section 96 of the Act.

Beginning January up to today, there were four cases of sea robbery in

There were two or three groups of sea robbers operating in that area

charged in courts due to lack of evidence.
Mangsur said their activities were not classified as piracy because
they only took boat engines from the fishermen as piracy involves taking
over of a vessel and its valuable cargo as well as kidnapping the crews on
board.
When asked about the probe on geniune Malaysian identity cards issued

The investigation is currently undertaken by the Sabah police and only

Deva Gang, was sentenced to 50 months' jail by the Sessions Court here
today after he pleaded guilty to robbing a security guard of RM2.19 million
in Universiti Malaya campus a day before Chinese New Year in January.
Judge Nursinah Adzmi ordered Tham Mao Hsiung, 36, to serve the sentence
from the day of his arrest on Feb 5.
Tham, a mobile phone trader from Padang Besar, Perlis, was charged with
robbing security guard Mohd Firdaush Daud, 25, of Safeguard Securicor Sdn
Bhd, with three others still at large in front of Kompleks Perdana Siswa in
the campus here at 1.40pm on Jan 28.
According to the facts of the case, Mohd Firdaush, along with three
colleagues, arrived in front of Kompleks Perdana Siswa in a company van to
put money into a RHB Bank automated teller machine (ATM) located at the
complex.
As soon as the side door of the van was opened, Tham and his
accomplices rushed into the van and ordered Mohd Firdaush to open the
vaulting safe and subsequently made off with six black canvas bags
containing RM2.19 million.
Tham and his three accomplices fled in a grey Nissan X-Trail sports
utility vehicle (SUV).
Mohd Firdaush lodged a police report about the robbery.
Acting on the information, the police launched an investigation and
found a black canvas bag together with eight empty cartridges along a
highway near Jalan Klang Gate in Taman Malawati in the outskirts of the
city
They also found the SUV used in the robbery in Taman Sri Ukay, Ulu

firearms on the day and place of the robbery but on Sept 15, he was
discharged not amounting to an acquittal.

to impose the most lenient sentence on him on the grounds that no one was

friends.

"YOUTH SENTENCED TO DEATH FOR MURDERING GROCER IN ROBBERY
COURT-MURDER
SEREMBAN, Oct 29 (Bernama) -- The High Court here today sentenced to death a
20-year-old former mechanic for the murder of a grocer who was killed in front
of his son two years ago.
Justice Datuk Ahmad Nafsy Yasin handed down the sentence after finding R.
Thamorharan guilty.
However, the court acquitted and discharged G. Chandramogan, 23, the second
accused in the case, of the charge.
Thamorharan and Chandramogan were jointly charged with the murder of Mohamad
Jabrullah Abd Wahab, 62, at the Jayamas Supermarket, Nilai, about 10.45pm on
July 31, 2008.
They were charged under Section 302 of the Penal Code, read together with
Section 34 of the same law, which carried the mandatory death sentence upon
conviction.
In his judgment, Ahmad Nasfy said the court found that Tharmorhan had
intention to kill the victim.
""The defence failed to prove that the accused had no intent to kill and the
court had no other choice, but to sentence him to death,"" he added.
However, he said the court had to acquit and discharge Chandramogan as there
were doubts on whether he knew the first accused was carrying a knife because
their plan was only to rob the victim.
Furthermore, when Thamorharan stabbed the victim, Chandramogan did not see
it, he added.
Mohamad Jabrullah and his 21-year-old son were closing their shop when they
were robbed by the two men.
Deputy public prosecutor Wan Shaharuddin Wan Ladin prosecuted, while
Thamorharan and Chandramogan were represented by lawyers S.Puspa Nathan and

KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 29 (Bernama) -- A robber was probably banking on the
idea that the security guards on their daily collection round at a petrol
station in Taman Shamelin Perkasa, Cheras, here, were unarmed when he
boldly grabbed the bag of RM50,000 cash from them.
Armed with a .22 pistol, the 42-year-old man parked his grey Perodua
MyVi next to the petrol station and walked to the guards who were loading
the bag into an armoured van in the 12.45pm incident.
""The suspect, who worked alone, didn't know that one of the security
guards was armed because his gun holster was positioned at the back instead
of at his side. So the suspect simply grabbed the bag and made a run for
it,"" Cheras OCPD ACP Rusli Ahmad told reporters at the scene today.
However, he said, the armed security guard pursued him and released
four shots, two of which hit the suspect on the chest and killed him
instantly.
He said police found nothing suspicious in the suspect's car.
Meanwhile, M. Kanda, the group general manager of the Cisco Group of
Companies which the security guards work for, told Bernama that daily
collection rounds took place between 11am and noon.
""The robber had probably been monitoring the collection time for a

He said only two security guards were assigned for collection in the
area today but one of them was armed with a revolver.
The security company is in charge of collecting the daily earnings at
many petrol stations nationwide to be deposited into banks.
Kanda said a similar incident occurred in Perai at the end of last

"NO WAREHOUSE ROBBERY IN JURU ON DEC 25, POLICE SAY
Police-Deny
BUKIT MERTAJAM, Dec 30 (Bernama) -- Police have refuted a claim by the
Penang Freight Forwarders Association (PFFA) that a warehouse in Juru was
robbed on Dec 25.
What actually happened at the warehouse was a theft involving a
conspiracy between its workers and outsiders, said State CID chief SAC II
Abdul Samah Mat today.
He told reporters here that the case did not involve a break-in and
robbers wielding parangs as alleged by the association.
""Investigations revealed that the theft occurred out of a scheme by
someone from outside and people in the warehouse.
""It's true that the thieves came in a container lorry in pretext of
carrying goods for shipment,"" he said.
""Police received a complaint about goods missing from the warehouse on
Dec 26 at about 1am. On arrival at the scene, police received another
complaint that five pallets containing printed circuit boards worth over
RM2 million were missing from the warehouse,"" he said.
The goods, belonging to a multinational company, were said to have gone
missing at about 8.30pm on Dec 24, he said.
He said that preliminary investigations revealed that the goods were
stolen by insiders and on the same day, the police arrested eight people
including a woman to assist in the probe.
Following the arrest, police picked up a man and a woman yesterday, he
said.
Abdul Samah said all the 10 people arrested, aged between 20 and 40
years, were from Seberang Perai Utara.
""Police regret the PFFA's allegation and consider it as wild and hasty.
""Not that the police don't want to disclose their investigation into
the incident but it is still under probe and can adversely affect police
investigation,"" he said.
On the PFFA's claim that the police did not view as serious information
received through SMS that a robbery was about to happen, Abdul Samah said
that was not true because the police had carried out patrols at all
industrial areas after receiving the SMS.
""In Seberang Perai alone, there are 1,625 factories and it is
impossible for us to focus on just certain areas and we conduct patrols at
all places,"" he said.
Yesterday, PFFA president Joachim Loo told a press conference that the
association had lodged a police report saying most of its members had
received SMS warning them that a robbery was to happen.
However, the police did not take the SMS warning seriously and had
interrogated the PFFA members instead, he said.
He said that the information turned out to be true after robbers made
off with computer peripherals worth over RM2 million from a warehouse in
Juru last Sunday.
The PFFA said five men wielding parangs were believed to have hit the
warehouse and fled with goods belonging to Solectron Technologies Sdn Bhd
but the police had tried to hide the incident.

Edmonds said 11,079 cases were reported last year, a negligible decrease
of only seven cases from 1999 when 11,086 reports were received.
Of these, 1,089 cases involved violence (1,102 in 1999), while 9,990
cases involved property crime (9,984 in 1999).
There were 1,725 reports of snatch theft (1,682 in 1999).
Edmonds was, however, happy that the State police had performed better
by scoring a crime solving rate of 30.8 per cent last year, which was 8.1
per cent higher than the previous year.
""This means we managed to solve one out of every three crimes reported
to us last year, which is quite a good rate in terms of crime-solving,"" he
added.
Edmonds, however, expressed concern that several categories of crime -
burglary, theft of motor vehicles and snatch thefts - were on the
increase.
""I have directed all district police chiefs and criminal investigation
officers in the State to focus on reducing such crimes,"" he said.
There were 2,337 cases of break-ins last year, which was a 3.4 per cent
increase over the 2,261 cases reported in 1999.
There was a 40.5 per cent increase in the theft of motorcars, up from
185 cases in 1999 to 260 last year, while theft of motorcycles increased
by 5.3 per cent from 2,706 to 2,850 last year.

"Soldiers held over burglary

SUNGAI PETANI: Shots were fired when police had to defend themselves
against three army privates who were trying to burgle a cellular phone
shop. Two of the would-be burglars were injured.
The three men from the Army Intelligence Corps 165 allegedly broke into
the shop in Tikam Batu, about 20km from their camp, about 4am. They
started quarrelling when all they found were some used handphones,
imitation housings and pouches and some cheap accessories.
After a complaint about the noise, a patrol car was despatched. Seeing
two policemen approaching the shop, one of the suspects charged at them
with a iron rod, ignoring their warnings to stop. One of the policemen
opened fire, shattering the suspect's right kneecap.
Seeing his accomplice injured, a second suspect grabbed part of the
iron window grille they had removed to get into the shop and also charged
at the policemen.
Fearing for his colleagues' lives, the driver of the patrol car fired
three times, hitting the suspect in the left leg. The third suspect
surrendered.
Police picked up three more privates in their barracks. It is believed
they were waiting in a Perodua Kancil and fled when their partners in
crime were arrested.
State Chief Police Officer Datuk Zuber Shariff said his men had acted
in self-defence.
The wounded suspects were in stable condition while their accomplices
were being held at the district police lock-up.

"Lock thwarts burglary at ex-IGP's home
Source:New Straits Times
PETALING JAYA: The spate of robberies and burglaries at homes of retired
senior police officers continued yesterday, and this time it was the home
of former Inspector-General of Police Tun Hanif Omar.
The burglars gained entry into the house in Jalan USJ 12/3B through an
open bathroom window and carted away a DVD player and several home
theatre speakers worth a total of RM2,000 from a ground floor common room.
However, they were unable to gain access to the rest of the house
because Hanif's wife, Toh Puan Hamidah Abdul Hamid, had gotten a second
lock installed on the door of the common room.
Hamidah said the lock had probably saved their belongings and
themselves from the robbers.
""Ever since I became a policeman's wife, I have been conscious about
safety.
""So when we moved into this house after Hanif's retirement 13 years
ago, I requested all these locks installed on each door in the house and
other security measures for our safety.
""And I am glad it served its purpose,"" said the 68-year-old at their
house yesterday.
Hamidah said they were only informed of the incident at 6.30am by their
two maids.
""They discovered the grille and sliding door open, so when they told us
about it, we both came down prepared for the worst, with our guns in
hand,"" she said.
Hamidah said the burglars were able to gain entry because one of her
maids had accidentally left the bathroom window open and the family's
lawn security detector had to be switched off due to renovation works at
their kitchen.
""We will make some security adjustments and it will all be taken care
of,"" she said.
Hanif, when contacted later, said his maids lodged a report at the USJ
8 police station after discovering the incident.
He said this was the first time burglars had managed to enter his home.
Previously, burglars had only managed to get as far as the compound of
the house, making off with iron garden chairs.

the string of Ar-Rahn Islamic pawnbroking shops, has paid out about RM10
million in compensation to depositors who lost their gold jewellery when
one of its branches here was burgled in August.
PKB general manager Mohd Sabri Abdullah said it had to dig into its own
pockets to settle the payments as insurance coverage from Syarikat
Takaful Malaysia Berhad (Takaful Malaysia) came to only RM5 million.
""The actual losses were nearly RM17 million. It is quite hard on us,
but we will cover the balance needed by taking it from the other
companies in the group,"" he said after receiving the RM5 million payout
from Takaful Malaysia at the menteri besar's office yesterday.

200 safe boxes in the vault.

"Burglary gang crippled

JOHOR BARU, Tues. - Police have arrested eight members of an armed robbery
gang who were responsible for pulling off 23 heists over the last four
months.
The gang, which included a 23-year-old woman, had held-up individuals,
shops and had burglarised houses around the city, making off with a total
of some RM60,000, mostly in cash.
Johor Baru district police chief Senior Assistant Commissioner Abu Bakar
Said the gang, aged between 20 and 40 years, armed themselves with parangs
and moved around on motorcycles bearing false registration plates.
The law finally caught up with them when police, who were tracking the
gang, managed to arrest two of its members at a house in Taman Ungku Tun
Aminah on Dec 12.
Over the next few days, police arrested the remaining six gang members.
Abu Bakar said that while the cash stolen by the gang could not be
recovered, police, however, managed to recover some electronic items,
including Walkman tape recorders, cameras and handphones.
He said most of the gang members were originally from other States, but
settled in Johor Baru several years ago to work in Singapore as contract
workers.
""Since jobs are harder to come by now, we believe the gang members
turned to a life of crime,"" he said.

KLANG, Mon. - Police busted two burglary gangs, sought for the past year,
with the arrests of 12 suspects in a series of raids since early this
month.
One of the gangs, dubbed the seluar pendek (short pants) gang, exposed
itself when one of the members left behind his cellular handphone while
making its getaway following an abortive break-in at Kampung Jawa last
Wednesday.
District police chief Assistant Commissioner Aziz Ariarasa Abdullah said
the recovery of the handphone enabled police to track down the gang
members.
Relating the success, Aziz said five men broke into the home of a 47-
year-old businessman in Kampung Jawa during the wee hours of Wednesday.
The businessman was awakened from his sleep by noises.
Suspecting something amiss, the businessman grabbed a piece of wood and
waited behind his bedroom door.
On hearing his father's screams, the businessman opened the door and
found his father surrounded by three men armed with knives.
The businessman went for one of the robbers and a scuffle ensued during
which he was injured in the left arm.
On seeing the businessman bleeding, the gang members panicked and fled,
leaving the handphone behind.
Investigations revealed the suspects, all Indonesians, were sought in
connection with four break-ins and robberies reported in Kapar, three
cases in Padang Jawa, two in Pandamaran and one each in Meru and Klang.
In the other success, police arrested four men, aged in their 20s,
sought in connection with 17 house break-ins reported since Feb 6 last
year.
Aziz said police got their break when one of the gang members was
apprehended for trespassing at a factory, off Jalan Kapar, on Jan 4.
Following interrogation, the suspect led police to the arrests of three
other gang members.
The suspects are believed to have used stolen money for their daily
expenses, purchase of a motorcycle and car, settle debts, and purchase of
three cows and three goats.
""They even donated to a fund set up for the Bosnians,"" Aziz said.

KUALA LUMPUR, Mon. - Police have smashed four house breakin and robbery
gangs, including a husband-and-wife team which led an affluent lifestyle.
They arrested 14 people and recovered about RM300,000 in cash and
valuables.
They also seized an assortment of weapons, break-in tools and three
cars, including one that was reported stolen.
The couple, both with criminal records and believed to be dadah addicts,
lived in a condominium in Bukit OUG, off Jalan Klang Lama, which is an
upper-middle class neighbourhood.
They were believed to have kept to themselves and seldom mixed with
neighbours. When night fell, their double life began.
Operating mostly at night, the couple, in their 30s, would cruise the
city and housing estates in Petaling Jaya and Puchong to look for targets.
City Chief Police Officer Deputy Commissioner Datuk Dell Akbar Khan said
the couple were involved in various crimes, including house and apartment
break-ins, car break-ins, car thefts, snatch thefts and robberies.
""They would drive around or ride around on motorcycles, mostly stolen
vehicles, and look for opportunities.
""Sometimes they would observe people making withdrawals at banks or ATMs
(automated teller machines) and follow them.
""If these people left their bags with the cash unattended in the car,
they will break in and steal them,"" he said, adding that the couple would
take turns to wear a wig when on the ""job"".
The couple's crime spree ended when a report was lodged by two security
guards of a condominium in Bukit Gembira on June 30.
The guards had spotted the couple trying to break into a car parked
outside the condominium and had confronted them.
Last Monday, police raided the couple's apartment and arrested them.
They found credit cards, identity cards, drivers' licences, handphones,
cameras, valuables and a limited edition gold coin collectors' set minted
to commemorate the handing over of Hong Kong to China in 1997.
""We also seized several knives and the wig. They have admitted to more
than 50 cases of break-ins, robberies and snatch thefts,"" Dell Akbar said
at a Press conference at the Brickfields police headquarters.
In another case, police arrested six men on July 7, two weeks after a
motorcyclist claimed that he was robbed by three men near the Brickfields
interchange of the Federal Highway.
The motorcyclist said he was stopped by the three who were in a Proton
Wira. Two of them alighted from the vehicle armed with parangs and took
his handphone and cash.
Investigations led police to the arrests of the six in Jalan
Thambipillai, Brickfields, and the seizure of seven parangs, several crash
helmets and jackets in the boot of a Proton Perdana reported stolen in
Kelana Jaya, recently.
""The gang was involved in 21 robbery cases in Brickfields and another
nine in Petaling Jaya,"" said Dell Akbar.
Police are looking for a man who goes by the name of Yusof Mamak to
assist investigations into the gang's activities.
On July 9, police arrested two men in Taman Ukay Perdana, Ampang, who
are believed to be involved in three break-ins at the Sentral Apartment
complex in Brickfields and another in the Gasing Heights condominiums in
Petaling Jaya.
Police recovered branded pens, helmets, a golf set, gloves and car keys
from the two.
""They also seized a crowbar and a saw used to break into cars, houses
and apartments, an air pistol and a BMW car owned by one of the men,"" said

In this context, Dong said one of the main issues was how to link the
Chinese characteristics with universal international laws and conventions
in economic legislation.
For example, he said, in drawing up a bankruptcy law, it was hard to
define the applicable field.
""Because in China we do not have a complete set of laws and regulations
for property declaration and supervision of citizens, and we also lack
efficient and effective measures to prevent concealment of properties in
order to avoid debt responsibilities,"" he added.
Dong said of the 152 legislative proposals drawn up by the Standing
Committee of the NPC in 1994, 53 were laws pertaining to the socialist
market economy.
""Up to May this year, from these 152 legislative proposals, NPC has
examined 61 law proposals and passed 51 laws, where 23 laws are about the
economy,"" he said.
Among the economic laws, the important ones were the Company Law, the
Budget Law, the Central Bank Law, the Comercial Banking Law, the Labour
Law, the Bills Law and the Insurance Law. -- BERNAMA

"LORRY DRIVER'S RECKLESS DRIVING TRIAL FIXED FOR OCT 7
Court-Driver
TELUK INTAN, Sept 2 (Bernama) -- The Magistrate's Court here today
fixed Oct 7 for the trial of a lorry driver charged with reckless driving
and causing the deaths of six people.
Magistrate Nor Aishah Raja Musa fixed the date after the charge against
Nazarudin Abdul Hamid was changed from dangerous driving to that of
reckless driving.
Nazarudin, 35, is alleged to have driven recklessly and caused the
deaths of Ahmad Kamal Mohamed Yunus (45), his wife, Siti Asiah Dollah (35),
and children Nurulhuda (16), Muhamad Syazwan (7), Muhammad Faiz (6) and
Nurul Izzati (1) at 19KM Jalan Ferry-Hutan Melintang, here, at 2.20pm on
Nove 10 last year.
Earlier, prosecuting officer, Chief Insp M. Vesanathan had preferred a
new charge against Nazarudin alleging that he had driven his lorry in a
reckless manner or with excessive speed or in a manner dangerous to the
public.
The magistrate asked the prosecution to decide on the charge it wanted
to bring against Nazarudin after defence counsel V.T.Singam objected,
saying that the prosecution was now bringing three new offences against his
client.
He said it was unfair and prejudicial to have three distinct offences
in one charge although they were all under section 41 (1) of the Road
transport Act.
After two hours' adjournment to seek directions from the deputy public
proseuctor's office, Chief Insp Vesanathan told the court that he was
proceeding with the reckless driving charge.
The charge carries a maximum five years' jail or RM10,000 fine, or
both, on conviction. The court can also suspend the offender's driving
licences for at least 12 months. -- BERNAMA

"158 detained nationwide for reckless driving in 18 days
Source:New Straits Times
KUALA LUMPUR, Thurs. - Police have detained 158 motorists for reckless
driving nationwide over an 18-day period until yesterday, in response to
directives from the Inspector-General of Police, Tan Sri Rahim Noor.
Federal traffic chief Senior Assistant Commissioner I Datuk Supian Amat
today said that since Feb 14, police had stepped up their enforcement
under the Road Transport Act 1987.
It was intended to change the attitude of motorists, as Malaysia had one
of the highest accident rates in the region, with a daily average of 70.
""Hopefully, our enforcement will act as a deterrent as we do not want
our roads to be turned into rivers of death,"" Supian said at a Press
conference at the Federal police headquarters in Bukit Aman.
Of the 158 motorists, 15 were detained under Section 41(1) of the RTA
for dangerous driving causing deaths, 43 under Section 42 (1) for illegal
racing and dangerous driving, and 100 under Section 45(A) for driving
under the influence of alcohol.
Upon conviction, Section 41(1) carries a maximum imprisonment of 5 years
or RM10,000 fine, or both; Section 42(1) a maximum jail term of three
years or RM6,000 fine, or both; and Section 45(A) a maximum term of six
months or RM2,000 fine, or both.
Supian said that 10 of those detained under Section 41(1) were remanded
between two and seven days under Section 117 of the Criminal Procedure
Code to facilitate police investigation.
The other 148 were detained over 24 hours and released on police bail.
Of the 158 motorists, Kuala Lumpur topped the list with 127 arrests. One
of them was detained under Section 41(1) and subsequently remanded, 30
under Section 42(1) and 96 were detained under Section 45(A).
Selangor had the second highest number of arrests with 11. Four were
detained under Section 41(1) and subsequently remanded, three under
Section 42(1) of whom one was remanded, and four under Section 45(A).
They were followed by Johor (seven); Penang (five); Sarawak (three); and
Sabah (two), while Negeri Sembilan, Terengganu and Kelantan had one each.
""We are also recommending to the Attorney-General's Chambers to charge
one of those detained under Section 304(b) of the Penal Code, in view of
the seriousness of the offence and public concern.
""We view this as a criminal offence and believe that we have a strong
case to charge the motorist, as we have sufficient evidence to show that
the driver's action caused a death without intention to kill.""
Under Section 112 of the Road Transport Act, 1987, Supian said the
police were empowered to detain a motorist without a warrant.
Meanwhile, police will, from today, use the definition `crash' instead
of `accident', to emphasise the seriousness of motor vehicle accidents.
Supian said the word `accident' was deemed inappropriate.
""Often, people attribute accidents to fate, whereas, the use of the word
`crash' connotes a deliberate, negative act,"" he said. In other countries,
the term `homicide' was used to define motor vehicle accidents which
resulted in death.
Supian, however, said the force had not referred the use of the term
`crash' to the Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka.
According to a Bernama report, Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka public sector
language development division head Zaiton Abdul Rahman said the words
`accident' and `crash' were inter-changeable.

City police CID deputy chief ACP Ramli Din said the 44-year-old man, Md

razed the computer laboratory of Universiti Teknologi Malaysia's city
campus at Jalan Semarak here.
""He was a security guard working at the campus who was interviewed by
the media about the fire and was coincidentally killed in an accident

Ramli said a news report by a local Malay daily yesterday which
speculated that Md Noor was ""mysteriously killed in a hit-and-run"" incident
was inaccurate.
""The real witness is alive and safe, and police are waiting for the
Fire and Rescue Department's investigation report on the fire,"" he added.
In another case, Ramli said police were investigating a single mother's
claim of alleged verbal abuse and molestation on her and one of her two
daughters by police personnel during an anti-vice and piracy operation at

their proof of identification.

legislation including mandatory jail sentence to deal with hit-and-run
offenders.
In a statement today, MCPF chairman Datuk Lee Lam Thye said hit-and-run
cases are most despicable and the government must introduce stringent
legislation to deal with such cases by imposing mandatory jail terms for
those convicted to fit the severity of the offence.
Citing the recent hit-and-run case involving the death of 19-year-old
schoolgirl Cheong Sin Ying at Jalan Kuchai Lama on Wednesday, he said
although the culprit has surrendered to the police, the authorities should
take a serious view of similar cases reported in the media from time to
time.
Yesterday, Traffic Police deputy chief DSP Jamaludin Khalid said the
police would submit investigation papers on the case to the Deputy Public
Prosecuter for his approval to prosecute the motorist under section 41(1)
of the Road Transport Act for reckless driving resulting in death.
Under the section, a person could be jailed for up to five years, fined
not more than RM10,000 or both upon conviction.
Lee also praised the Selangor police for setting up police service
kiosks in shopping complexes and supermarkets to enable the public to
settle summonses and make complaints against errant policemen.
""While moves to make public dealings with the police more friendlier
are welcomed, greater efforts must be made to improve the image of the

He suggested that the police department set up a special task force

"JUDICIARY STUDIES WAYS OF SPEEDING UP CASES
Judiciary-Efficient
KOTA BAHARU, Sept 11 (Bernama) -- The judiciary is looking at ways of
speeding up the handling of cases, by revamping several procedures in court
especially those involving backlogs.
Chief Justice Tan Sri Ahmad Fairuz Sheikh Abdul Halim said today the
judicial institution was working hard to be more efficient in handling each
case, without sacrificing the principles of justice.
""We are looking at ways of speeding up the handling of cases, we have
also held discussions. There are ways of tackling it, we only need to
revamp several procedures that will take a little time,"" he told reporters
after a meeting with High Court Judges for the East Coast Zone, here.
Present at the meeting were Kota Baharu High Court Judge Datuk Sulaiman
Daud, Kuantan High Court Judge Datuk Heliliah Yusof, Pahang Judicial
Commissioner Datuk Mohd Apandi Ali and Kuala Terengganu High Court Judge
Datuk Ahmad Maarof.
Ahmad Fairuz said the meeting was being held according to the zones,
namely Eastern, Southern, Northern and Central zones, so that each judge
could voice their opinions.
""We are tackling the issue (speeding up cases), we will move faster to
achieve the target. We hope that by next year at least in the eastern zone,
if someone has been charged in court, the case would be completed within a
year.
""However, we have to think about the appeal which takes a much longer
time. At the moment, we have to concentrate on the High Court first, then
only we look at the other courts in stages,"" he said.
Ahmad Fairuz said in Kelantan, Terengganu and Pahang, the rate of case
settlements in courts for civil and criminal cases was encouraging.
He also said priority would be given to cases involving offenders who
were remanded without bail such as murder and drug cases.
On the causes for the backlog of cases, Ahmad Fairuz said the main
reasons were the lack of witnesses or witnesses falling sick, and defence
counsels or prosecutors being involved in other cases.
""On technical reasons, we already have the law, it depends on the
judges to apply the procedures or laws on each case,"" he added.

"Cover Story: Speeding up approvals
Source:The Edge
Let's go on to the part about corruption, procurement and some of the land
issues. The perception is that unless you pay civil servants, nothing moves very
fast, especially in terms of land matters which involve states. Dr Munir, what
does the private sector think in terms of getting approvals and so on?
Munir: I can give a concrete example: [to get] approval for a low cost budget
hotel, [the hotel] is required to have sufficient parking space because a hotel
must have parking space, but you know the clientele are usually backpackers. So,
why on earth should you have parking space? For visa arrivals of the Indians and
Chinese, it is a conflict between the Ministry of Tourism and Home Affairs. They
have different interests to protect.
I would propose a kind of a GLC (government linked company) transformation plan
which has been very successful, I think, this administration's most successful
corporate exercise. Have certain KPIs (key performance indicators), certain
deliverables to make it not just the Pemudah micro thing but also to have a
macro framework and then measuring achievement. Have those different colour
books, if you like. I think it might be something that we also need to do
organically or semi organically to try and move it along, you know your point
about procurement corruption.
Not just procurement but also in some land approvals. I think the problem with
land is not so much that approvals are not obtained but very often when it is
approved, there is no concern in terms of setting aside space and preserving
green areas, forest reserves.
Munir: Many have slipped between cup and lip. This administration has emphasised
the environment rather more than the previous administration.
Raja Aman: Dr Munir, we are now almost at the people part of it. You see, you
need to change the people who are dealing with the process. Of course, I think
the process also has a lot of details within the process itself which involves
law, which involves technology but I think the bulk of it is the people. So, I
think attention now is focused on the people. Just like Dr Munir said, we are
now focusing on the top actions first.
Sidek: We are going to do what has been done in the GLCs. Best practices seem to
work. There are two areas we are focusing on. One is the issue of land, you
banyak kali mentioned [that] and the other issue is PBT beyond just land. Pihak
Berkuasa Tempatan the local authority. When my kampung people Paloh deals
with the government, they want to pay cukai tanah once a year and they are
dealing with that clerk, dekat Pejabat Tanah di Pekan, and there and that is the
government or when they tengok sampah not collected during Raya recently, when I
was in Mecca, people still send me SMS and emails terrible people
complaining about Selayang (has) no garbage collection although it has been
outsourced but they thought this is the problem of the municipalities. They
thought it is still a government [matter]. Now MPAJ (Majlis Perbandaraan Ampang
Jaya) Ampang Jaya Municipal Council 40% of their revenue is spent on angkat
sampah but it is also outsourced but they still think that the problem rests
with MPAJ.
But wouldn't it be MPAJ's problem because if the outsourcers don't perform, the
MPAJ
Sidek: Exactly. Where would the ball end, where would it stop it stops, ya lah,
but surely when you outsource somebody to do it, it is your business to make
sure (this information is conveyed). But this information, as you have said,
Tunku, has not been conveyed enough to the public; they still blame MPAJ when in
fact the first point of blame should be on the outsourcing company. There are
two areas where the government can do a lot of things, one is the local
and the other is land, we are already putting a lot of focus on this.
Munir:  Some of my members (Kuala Lumpur Business Club or KLBC) still need to
get FIC (Foreign Investment Committee) approval for transfer of property even
from Malaysian to Malaysian and it is supposed to take two weeks, but some
people say it takes more than two months. Do we still need to get that approval?
I think that you also need to get state approval for some of the land
transactions on top of that.
Sidek: You mentioned that FIC tak ada but you still insist on sending...
Sometimes, of course, maybe it is their fault, maybe you should 'say no need to
come to us' but you still come. I think these are the issues as Tunku mentioned
earlier
I think that sometimes they do not know what exactly are the regulations
somebody announces something but it is not written down anywhere.
Sulaiman: KSN has instructed us to go online. Also, we are now working with the
IT side so that they can just submit to us online.
Munir: I remember my merchant banking days, we have a set of guidelines, FIC
guidelines. Is there a new text?
Sulaiman: Yes, yes, it (has) changed a lot.
Tunku Aziz: You mentioned e knowledge. I think if we really were to implement e
government seriously, this would help.
Tan Sri, e government?
Sidek: This is exactly what we are doing.You see, dulu, my complaint the bane
of the local authorities before everytime mau tengok muka orang. When I anak
angkat (adopted) MPAJ, they didn't do it (e government), now they do it.
Therefore, they can do cukai pintu through electronic government. If, therefore,
now MPAJ can do anjing punya lesen online, why can't the other local

"SPEEDING DRIVERS GIVING AIRPORT'S LIMO SERVICE A BAD NAME
Limo-safety
KUALA LUMPUR, July 16 (Bernama) -- Nothing is more depressing than to
see your planned holiday overseas ends in a tragedy, minutes after you
arrive at the airport.
That's what happened to a Swiss couple last June 24 as they headed
towards the city from the KL International Airport (KLIA) in Sepang to a
hotel in a limousine.
The limo driver reportedly failed to avoid a trailer which had skidded
after one of its tyres burst, killing Gerard Philip Passian, 68, and
injuring his wife in the accident.
According to the traffic police, they have issued some RM604,000 in
speeding tickets to limo drivers during the two years the airport has been
in operation.
Several users of the limo service have also expressed concern over the
matter, fearing that such attitude could mar the image of KLIA, one of the
most amazingly designed international airports in the world.
Foreign tourists have also written to the local newspapers, relating
their hair-raising ride in airport's limousine taxis.
Bukit Aman Traffic Enforcement Officer DSP Karim Abu said many limo
drivers drove fast because they wanted to earn more money.
A limo driver reportedly is paid a certain amount of commission per
trip from the KLIA to any destination in the Klang Valley. The more trips
he makes, the more money he will earn.
Karim said that up to March this year, 2,016 summonses had been issued
to limousine taxis belonging to the Airport Limo (M) Sdn Bhd.
""Four limo drivers have been booked over 70 times, 11 over 40 times, 33
over 20 times and the others, booked over five times each,"" he told
Bernama.
He said the limo drivers should care for the safety of their passengers
and not obssessed with making more trips.
""They have a responsibility to portray a good image of the country to
the visitors, besides providing a safe and comfortable journey,"" he said.
National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Chairman
Datuk Lee Lam Thye said the efforts made by the government to woo foreign
tourists would come to nought if they got the wrong pictures arising from
the attitude of the airport limo drivers.
""Limo drivers should not put other people in danger. Passengers' safety
should be their top priority rather than profits,"" he said.
Entrepreneur Development Minister Datuk Seri Mohd Nazri Aziz said the
ministry would introduce a new approach soon to improve the airport's limo
service and overcome problems such as the long wait, unsatisfactory service
and so forth.
""With regards to speeding limo drivers and speeding summonses, I'm
waiting for the report from the police,"" he said.
The senior manager (public relations) of the Airport Limo Sdn Bhd,
Aminuddin Ibrahim said the company had taken actions against its drivers
frequently booked by the police for speeding, including showcause letters
and asking them to settle the summonses themselves.
On claim that the limo drivers were chasing after more trips, he said,
""How many trips can they make when a return trip takes two and half hours?
I believe, it's the fault of the limo drivers themselves for speeding,"" he
said.
The company has also put up stickers inside every limousine taxi,
telling passengers to call 03-8787-4502 and 03-8787-4503 if the driver is
speeding.
He admitted that the company had received lots of complaints from the
public of limo drivers speeding.
Users want stern action be taken against such limo drivers especially
when their carelessness later proved to be fatal.
Halimah Halim, 45, a clerk, said she was reluctant to believe at first
stories told by her friends of so called ""kaki pecut"" among the airport's
limo drivers until it happened to her.
She was heading towards Kuala Lumpur with the limo driver speeding when
a car in front suddenly slowed down. He slammed hard on the brake, causing
her head to hit the back of the front's seat.
""Luckily I was not injured and the driver told me that he had to speed
as he had another trip waiting. A friend told me later that the limo
drivers were chasing after trips to get more commission,"" she said.
Baruk Bajan, 33, from Sarawak, also had a similar experience from the
KLIA to Seremban.
""I was asked to share the taxi with another passenger since we were
heading the same way. The driver was speeding and overtaking in a dangerous
manner,"" he said.
He said he considered himself lucky to have reached home safe and
sound.

Court-Bus
KUALA LIPIS, Feb 17 (Bernama) -- An express bus driver charged with
driving recklessly and causing the death of 15 passengers at the Kuala
Lipis-Merapoh road in November last year was sentenced to seven years' jail
and fined RM10,000 in default 10 months' jail by the Magistrate's Court
here today.
Nik Zaini Nik Abdullah, 32, of Pasir Putih, was also suspended from
driving for 10 years when his driving licence was endorsed by the court.
Magistrate Kamal Azira Hassan ordered him to serve his sentence
immediately.
He rejected the application by defence counsel T.H.Tan for a stay of
execution pending appeal in the High Court.
Nik Zaini, of Ekspres Mutiara, was found guilty of committing the
offence at KM63 of the Kuala Lipis-Merapoh road at 1 am on Nov 30 last
year.
He was charged under Section 41 (1) of the Road Transport Act 1987
which carries a jail term of not less than two years and not exceeding 10
years and fine of not less than RM5,000 and not exceeding RM20,000 and
liable to have his driving endorsed.
In passing sentence, Kamal Azira said that the court had taken into
account and given consideration to various factors including the facts of
the case and the plea in mitigation by Nik Zaini.
He also said that the case was of public interest in view of the
seriousness of the offence due to the loss of so many lives and damage to
property as well as the grief and suffering of the victims and the bereaved
family members.
It brought to mind the poor attitude and indiscipline among road users,
he said.
He hoped that the sentence would serve as a deterrence to Nik Zaini and
to others.
Earlier in mitigation, Tan said that Nik Zaini was a first offender and
had given full cooperation during police investigations and throughout the
trial.
He said that Nik Zaini, who has a large family to support, was also
traumatised over the tragic accident and was now remorseful.
Deputy Public Prosecutor Ahmad Rosli Mohamed Sham responded by saying
that public interest must be taken into consideration due to the large
number of casualties involved.
He said that the sentence imposed must commensurate with the
seriousness of the offence and in view of the high rate of fatal accidents

"NO LAW TO REVOKE LICENCE OF SPEEDING TAXI DRIVERS
Taxi-Limo
KUALA LUMPUR, July 17 (Bernama) -- Shocking but true. A taxi driver can
be summoned up to 70 times for speeding and yet nothing can be done. This
was confirmed by the Road Transport Department (JPJ).
JPJ Public Relations Officer K. Balakrishnan said the lack of a
specific law to suspend or revoke the licence of such habitual offenders
had emboldened limousine drivers to continue committing speeding offences.
He said limousine drivers caught speeding would be given summonses and
those booked more than three times would be asked to show cause why they
should not be blacklisted.
""Blacklisted means as long as they (drivers) do not settle their
summonses, they cannot renew their driving licence and cannot pass the
Puspakom inspection done every six months,"" he said when commenting on a
Bernama report carried by newspapers today on speeding drivers who are
giving the KL International Airport limousine service a bad name.
The fine for a speeding offence is RM300.
As it is, there is no provision for suspending or cancelling the public
service vehicle licence, issued by the Commercial Vehicles Licensing Board,
of drivers caught speeding habitually.
""There is no record to show that a taxi driver has had his licence
withdrawn for speeding but if the offence is about misconduct...there is,""
he said.
According to Balakrishnan, offences of misconduct come under Section 56
(4) of the Road Transport Act 1987 which empowers the JPJ Director-General
to suspend or cancel the licence of a driver deemed dangerous to passengers
or other road users and is physically unfit to drive.
Such actions were normally taken after public complaints against
drivers were investigated, he said.
Asked on the possibility of speeding offences being classified under
this section to allow for the suspension or revocation of licence,
Balakrishnan said this was still at the preliminary stage of discussion.
""We will see whether it is appropriate...before any proposal is
forwarded to the (Transport) ministry,"" he said.
""JPJ views seriously the frequent summonses issued to Limo drivers,
especially for speeding, because it not only endangers passengers but also
does not give a good image to the country,"" he said.
Balakrishnan said the online summons system linking police and JPJ was
not efficient, and this enabled taxi drivers to renew their licences even
though they had many outstanding traffic tickets.
""This happened because data on summonses keyed in by the police
sometimes only reached the JPJ six months later,"" he said.
Balakrishnan said the JPJ was prepared to help the police ensure that
summonses issued to drivers were settled before they could renew their
driving licences.
Bukit Aman traffic chief SAC II Ahmad Baharin Idrus, when contacted,
admitted that limousine drivers appeared unperturbed by the summonses
issued to them.
""When we booked them, they just paid up and then repeated the offence,""
he said, adding that most limousine drivers paid their compound fines.
Ahmad Baharin said police always viewed seriously cases of speeding
involving limousine drivers.
""Efforts to check speeding among limo drivers and other road users are
continually taken with the cooperation of other agencies like the JPJ,"" he
said.
Malaysian Bumiputera Tour Agencies Association president Datuk Yaakub
Shah Md Ali Shah likened limousine drivers to F1 racers, saying he
regretted the attitude of some drivers who broke the speed limit without
thinking of the feelings of foreign tourists in their taxis.
""Maybe limo drivers were inspired by the F1-style driving as the Sepang
F1 circuit is located nearby,"" he said sarcastically.
""Of late, I have received many complaints, especially from foreign
tourists. They advised the limo drivers in a nice way but some drivers
showed their temper and gave excuses like chasing trips,"" he said.
Yaakub said taxi drivers had an important role to play in helping the
government to promote the tourism industry.
""If the tourism industry is developed, they will also benefit,"" he
said.
""There is no need to speed; just keep within the speed limits and tell
your passengers about the country, interesting places, tourist
destinations, historcial sites and the like,"" he said.
He called for a review of the system of paying drivers commission based
on the number of trips made.
""I feel this trip-based system is one of the reasons limo drivers
speed. So I think it should be changed to a better system,"" he said.

been identified as the main causes of the increase in fatal accidents
during the Ops Sikap III.
Of the 253 fatal crashes recorded in the 15-day operation, 80 cases or
31.6 percent of the drivers involved had committed these offences, federal
traffic chief Acting SAC II Koh Hong Sun said today.
He said the number of fatal accidents this year was an increase of 73
cases or 40.6 percent over the 180 cases reported in Ops Sikap I last year.
""The average number of fatal accidents daily during Ops Sikap III was
17 cases compared to 12 cases in Ops Sikap I,"" he told a news conference in

The number of deaths also rose by 62 or 27.8 percent, from 223 in Ops
Sikap I to 285 in Ops Sikap III, giving an average of 19 deaths per day
compared to 15 per day in Ops Sikap I.
""We have also identified indiscriminate overtaking and switching of
lanes as among the causes of the increase in fatal accidents, accounting
for 69 cases or 27.3 percent,"" he said.
Other common offences were following too close behind a vehicle (20
cases or 7.9 percent), hastiness in turning at junctions (16 cases or 6.3
percent), and carelessness (15 cases or 5.9 percent).
He said some accidents were also caused by motorists driving against
the flow of traffic.
""During Ops Sikap III from last Nov 29 to Dec 13, motorcyclists still

buses.
Under Ops Sikap III, Selangor had the highest number of fatalities with

total.
In terms of fatalities Johor was next with 39, Kedah (32), Perak (25),
Penang (21) and Negeri Sembilan (19).
""The higher accident rate was also due to the increase in the number of
vehicles on the road, and this year alone 11.9 million vehicles have been
registered,"" he said.
Ops Sikap III recorded 12,239 accidents or an average of 816 cases a
day, and this is an increase of 1,176 cases or 10.1 percent over the 11,063

"HIGH COURT ACQUITS BUS DRIVER OF RECKLESS DRIVING
Court-Driver
KUALA LUMPUR, March 21 (Bernama) -- A tour bus driver, who was jailed
30 months for dangerous driving resulting in an accident that caused the
death of three people last year, was today acquitted and discharged by the
High Court.
Justice Datuk Kang Hwee Gee, in quashing the conviction against Thoo
Eng Kee, accepted the possibility that Thoo's dangerous driving could be
due to a brake failure as claimed.
""If indeed there was a brake failure, then there is a reason why he
drove in a dangerous manner,"" he said in his judgment.
Thoo, 48, was found guilty by the Rawang Magistrate's Court of driving
the bus in a manner dangerous to the public and causing the death of Abdul
Aziz Mahmud, 60, his wife Rokiah Yaakub, 60, and their son, Abdul Ghani,
42, all burnt to death in the accident at a traffic light junction in Taman
Selasih, Batu Caves, at about 11.05am on Feb 22, last year.
(Only Abdul Ghani's three-year-old son, Muzakir, survived the accident
after he was pulled out of the burning Proton Tiara by a passer-by.)
He was charged five days later, under section 41 (1) of the Road
Transport Act 1987 which carries a penalty of up to five years' jail or a
maximum fine of RM10,000 or both if convicted.
The magistrate also suspended Thoo's driving licence for two years.
Kang said the magistrate, who sentenced Thoo on July 17 last year, did
not give credence to the evidence of a tourist guide which was very
crucial. The tourist guide, Siow Woon Fah, who was an independent witness,
had given a first hand account on how the accident occurred.
""Because of that, the magistrate should have given the benefit of the
doubt to the accused that there was a brake failure and there was no reason
to doubt him,"" he said.
Earlier in his submission, defence counsel T.Balaguru said Thoo had
pulled the handbrake and brought the gear down immediately after he
realised the brakes had failed but the weight of the bus had dragged it all
the way and hit the vehicles on the left and right before hitting the
Proton Tiara.
""Here, it was a case of mechanical failure so the element of
recklessness or dangerous driving was not there at all,"" he said.
It was unavoidable, he said.
(It was reported that the bus was carrying 40 Hong Kong tourists from
Genting Highlands).
Deputy Public Prosecutor Mohamad Hanafiah Zakaria, in his submission,
said based on Thoo's evidence, he had pressed the brake when the bus was
three cars away before the traffic lights.
""That distance is very near. My contention is it is very dangerous to
do so. He should have braked when coming down the flyover,"" he said.
Mohamad Hanafiah said if Thoo started to press the brake earlier, he
would had ascertained the brake system was not functioning and ""even if
there is mechnical fault on the brake system, to brake at that distance is
very dangerous"".

"1999: CRITICAL YEAR FOR SPEEDING UP FINANCIAL MERGERS
YEARENDER-FINANCIAL MERGERS
KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 23 (Bernama) -- As we usher in 1999, we are entering
the critical stage when Malaysia would like to see more financial mergers
so that existing institutions would evolve into bigger and stronger
entities before the country's financial market is fully opened.
Banking analysts are of the view that the merger exercise has to be
speeded up and that local financial institutions should seriously consider
1999 as the critical year for them to be more committed towards the move.
They said 1999 itself is a clear signal that ""we are not far from
reaching the next millennium"" when the new and significant challenges come.
They pointed out that in the wake of these challenges, especially the
liberalisation of financial markets in line with the World Trade
Organisation's (WTO) requirement, local financial institutions that did not
enter into mergers in time would face stiffer competition, in particular
from foreign institutions.
A senior banking analyst, who declined to be identified, said the
government's policy towards bank mergers was consistent since the 1980s and
that mergers had started from the mid-1980s and reached its peak in the
1990s.
He stressed that merger exercises in the country are taking place not
because of the economic crisis or problems faced by banks or insurance
companies but are necessitated by the need to strengthen the financial
institutions in the long run.
Citing an example, the government had announced early this year a
deadline for 39 finance companies to merge with eight ""anchor"" entities.
The eight anchor companies are Mayban Finance Bhd, Public Finance Bhd,
Hong Leong Finance Bhd, Arab-Malaysian Finance Bhd, EON Finance Bhd/Credit
Corporation (M) Bhd, United Merchant Finance Bhd, MBf Finance Bhd and Affin
Finance Bhd.
Banking expert Chie King Ngu of TA Securities Sdn Bhd said: ""The merger
exercises among the finance companies are progressing well but they are
moving very slowly, not at the pace that Bank Negara is expecting.""
As at September this year, three merger parties had signed sale and
purchase agreements while others had completed or were in the final stages
of due diligence.
Two finance companies - Kewangan Industri and RHB Finance - had been
absorbed by their parent banks.
Chie attributed the slow pace of the merger exercises to the current
economic downturn which had brought about some confusion with regards to
the pricing and valuation.
""Shareholders and owners of the banks are still reluctant to sell
although the economy had shown signs of recovery as they feel they could
not sell their assets at the real prices. There are some who are reluctant
to lose their licences which are deemed to be very valuable"", he said.
He said it is also timely for the central bank to identify ""anchors""
for both commercial and merchant banks, in the same manner as they had done
for the finance companies. When that is set, it will enable these
institutions to begin ""seeking"" suitable partners.
""The sooner, the better. There's no more time to waste,"" he asserted.
Asked which commercial banks he thinks are suitable to play an ""anchor""
role, Chie immediately singled out Malayan Banking Bhd, Public Bank Bhd,
RHB Bank Bhd and Commerce Asset Holdings Bhd.
""Like finance companies, Bank Negara will select about eight
financially strong commercial banks and those that I have mentioned are
among the clear candidates to be anchors, especially after taking into
account their assets holdings,"" he said.
To another question on foreign participation with regards to the merger
exercises, Chie said as far as he was concerned, the central bank's stand
is clear in that foreign participation is not allowed.
""Personally, I do not mind the competition because it is good for the
industry"", he said, adding that foreign participation is good in selected
areas, especially in the transfer of skill and technology.
As for the merger of insurance companies, an industry source said about
15 companies, mostly involved in the general insurance business, have
started ""talking"" to each other and things are progressing well.
Among those involved are Mayban Assurance Bhd, Sime AXA, Malaysia
National Insurance Bhd (MNI), Sun Alliance (M) Sdn Bhd, Royal Insurance (M)
Bhd, MCIS Insurance Bhd, UMBC Insurance Bhd, Arab-Malaysian Assurance Bhd,
Jernih Insurance Bhd, Paramount Assurance Bhd, Commercial Union Assurance
(M) Bhd, GA Insurance Bhd, Malaysia British Assurance Bhd (MBA) and
Malaysia National Reinsurance Bhd.
Mayban Assurance is one of the companies that is in the final stages of
negotiations, said the source, adding that ""they are currently talking to
at least three insurance firms, including UMBC Assurance"".
""More mergers are likely to take place next year,"" he said. -- BERNAMA

KONG-BUS
KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 24 (Bernama) -- The express bus involved in a crash that
killed 13 people at 223km North-South Expressway near Simpang Ampat toll plaza
was travelling at 120km per hour (km/h) after entering the expressway from Alor
Gajah toll.
Transport Minister Datuk Seri Kong Cho Ha said this was among findings of
a scientific analysis and study on the crash conducted by Malaysia Institute of
Road and Safety (Miros).
He said a coordination meeting involving relevant agencies such as Road
Transport Department, Computerised Vehicle Inspection System Centre (Puspakom),
police and Malaysian Highway Authority (LLM) had been carried out on Oct 14,
following the accident.
The reports were then compiled and analysed by the Miros crash
reconstruction team, he said in a statement here, tonight.
He said based on the crash impact energy analysis, the probable speed of
Delima Bus, which was carrying 36 passengers, before braking was between 94 and
109km/h.
""Furthermore, another vehicle involved in this collision might have been
travelling at sped of 160km/h at the time,"" he added.
In the 6.47pm accident on Oct 10, the Delima express bus heading to Kuala
Lumpur from Melaka went out of control, flipped over to the south-bound side of
the expressway and rammed into a van, two cars and another bus, leaving 13
people killed and 38 others injured.
On the condition of the express bus, Kong said periodic inspection from
Puspakom showed that the bus was in good condition.
""The tyres and brakes of the express bus were in good condition prior to the
crash as found by Puspakom during inspection after the collision,"" he said.
Kong said possible causes were sudden encroachment of other vehicles into
the bus lane, critical traffic flow in front and slow respond time by the
driver.
The number of casualties and injuries and the severity of the collision
could be avoided if everyone followed traffic rules and practised good driving
behaviour, travel within the speed limit, fasten front and rear seat belts while
heavy vehicles kept to the slow lane.
""Besides strict enforcement, road engineering and vehicle safety, the road

Bar-Reckless
KUALA LUMPUR, April 29 (Bernama) -- Mandatory jail for motorists found

Instead, motorists should be educated on road ethics and proper conduct

within the framework of the statute without the imposition of any mandatory
minimum sentence.
""In exercising their sentencing discretion, the courts can mete out
punishment that befits the gravity of the offence on a case by case basis.
""Imprisonment for reckless driving due to a lack of skill may not be
the proper punishment. However, reckless disregard by motorists for the
safety of other road users resulting in death may be a proper ground for
imposing custodial sentence,"" he said.
He said there were adequate provisions in the Penal Code to deal with
wanton display of thuggery and hooliganism on the road resulting in death.
""The Bar Council, while expressing serious concern over the high rate
of accidents on the road, however, feels that the proposed amendments might
not be the solution. There is an urgent need for educating the motorists on
road ethics and proper conduct on the road,"" he added.

"Tax breaks seen speeding up takaful industry growth
Source:Business Times
TAX holidays announced in Budget 2007 will drive existing takaful
operators here to expand overseas, insurers said, and make Malaysia
attractive as an international hub for foreign players.
The Government is offering a 10-year tax holiday on income derived from
takaful businesses conducted in international currencies.
This initiative will accelerate the growth of the takaful industry in
the country and, at the same time, tap the vast market for Islamic
insurance globally, insurers said.
""The 10-year tax holiday will certainly generate immense interest not
only from current takaful operators to start or write more off-shore
businesses, but more so, it will encourage foreign insurers to use
Malaysia as their international takaful hub,"" said Takaful Ikhlas
managing director Syed Moheeb Syed Kamarulzaman,
He said international takaful operators will also benefit from
Malaysia's Islamic finance and takaful expertise, regulatory framework,
Shariah investment instruments as well as a robust money and capital
market.
With the ability to do takaful and retakaful business at a lower cost,
both local and foreign insurers are already planning to take advantage of
the tax holiday.
""Our Internet-based information technology system is geared towards
doing off-shore businesses locally. It can support multi-currency
businesses and can be deployed for use anywhere in the world so long as
there is Internet connection. We are exploring the opportunities,"" said
Syed Moheeb.
The Budget proposal means local takaful operators need not set up
operations overseas. They can franchise products or services to a foreign
insurer in return for reinsurance business.
MCIS Zurich Insurance Bhd's chief executive officer Md Adnan Md Zain
said the tax exemption will be useful for start-up takaful operators to
be competitive from day one.
""And for those operators who already have global infrastructure, via
presumably strategic alliances with international partners, the tax
holiday allows for greater return of investments and quicker payback on
their investments,"" he said.
Md Adnan said MCIS Zurich is always on the lookout for opportunities to
grow its business, and the proposed incentives outlined in Budget 2007
""are certainly interesting enough for us to consider"".
Prudential BSN Takaful Bhd's chief executive officer Mohamad Salihuddin
Ahmad also voiced similar enthusiasm.
""We hope the Government will continue to provide additional incentives
to the Islamic financial sector to develop products for the foreign
market in order for us to compete better overseas and, at the same time,
help make Malaysia the preferred Islamic financial hub,"" he said.
Keith Driver, chief executive officer of HSBC Amanah Takaful (Malaysia)
Sdn Bhd, meanwhile, said that the company is already developing some
products and services intended for the overseas market.

"Fatal case of reckless driving: Mandatory jail sentence planned
Source:Business Times
MOTORISTS caught in a fatal case of reckless driving may find themselves
slapped with a mandatory jail sentence under the new amendments to the
Road Transport Act 1987.
Transport Minister Datuk Seri Dr Ling Liong Sik said the Cabinet
yesterday approved ministry plans to amend the Road Transport Act to
include a mandatory jail sentence in the wake of the increasing number of
deaths caused by reckless driving.
""Several amendments will be made (to the Act), in particular to include
a mandatory jail sentence on several wrongdoings. It is hope that this
will prevent further fatal accidents as a result of reckless driving,"" he
told reporters after the weekly Cabinet meeting in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.
He said based on a public survey carried out by the ministry last year,
the public has shown they are in favour of stiffer penalties for negligent
drivers who caused deaths.
At present, reckless drivers can be charged under section 41 (1) of the
Road Transport Act, which carries a maximum jail term of five years or a
fine of up to RM10,000 or both.
Dr Ling said the Road Transport Act will also include a new clause where
on first mention of the accident case in court, the driver's licence will
be suspended.
""This is to deter the motorist(s) concerned from driving and causing
more harm because sometimes court proceedings can take a long time,"" he
added.
Dr Ling also announced that a higher number of accidents occur on trunk
roads compared with highways.
""Last year, the number of road accidents in the country totalled
210,964. Of this total, 202,526 occurred on trunk roads and the remaining
8,438 on highways.
""In the same period, the number of deaths from road accidents rose to
5,744. Of this total, 5,400 occurred on trunk roads and the rest on
highways,"" he said.
Meanwhile, Dr Ling said the Cabinet has also directed the Road Transport
Department (RTD) to identify and punish the drivers of overloaded lorries
who had crashed through a RTD roadblock last month.
On April 28, in a desperate attempt to escape action, some 80 drivers of
overloaded lorries drove four abreast along the North-South Expressway to
break up a RTD roadblock near Nilai, Seremban.
Despite RTD officials at the roadblock ordering them to stop, six of the
lorries charged through. However, the rest decided to obey and pull over
to the side of the highway.

"Hit-and-run
Source:Malaysian Business
WHEN Junichiro Koizumi became prime minister in 2001, he revelled in
popularity over his bountiful hair and playboy looks. But the Japanese had
also placed their faith in Japan's cool dude to lift the economy out of
its 11-year slump. No gain without pain, Koizumi warned. Today, Japanese
are still feeling the pain, not from Koizumi's reforms, but from a meagre
upturn. Five years on and Asia's most powerful industrial behemoth looks
like a puffed-out dragon.
Forget Koizumi's gang-busting popularity start: the crash-through
politician looks to have crashed himself. His latest economic reform move
- to privatise Japan Post, which hoards YEN331 trillion (US$ 3 trillion)
in savings and life insurance accounts - hit the wall mid-August. His own
party, the ultra-conservative Liberal Democratic Party, cut him off at the
knees. For all his jawboning, Koizumi finally lost his cool and called a
snap poll.
Will voters let him sell off Japan Post? Not easily. For starters,
Koizumi, whose reforms agenda has been dodgy at best, had gotten ahead of
himself. His reform bills may have passed through the lower house but only
by five votes. So what was Koizumi thinking when he tried to crash them
through the insidious upper chamber? There his enemies waited. Led by
Mikio Aoki, the strongman who controls the most powerful LDP faction, and
his 22 hardline backers, stopped Koizumi dead in his tracks - and for more
than one reason.
Koizumi has long wanted to reform his fractious and corrupt ruling
party. But now he wants to dismantle it altogether. `I will smash the old
LDP and I will create a new one,' Koizumi defied the party's leadership
group after the vote. `I will not join hands with the old LDP. The party
will not endorse anyone who voted against these bills.' But Aoki had a job
to do: preserve the LDP for the faceless money-mandarins who run it from
behind bamboo curtains. Koizumi should have read Japanese history, and
especially the LDP's, more closely: he may be party president but he never
ran it, anymore than he'll be able to shred it.
Moreover, Koizumi's economic management record is his Achilles' heel.
The LDP has kept 63-year-old Koizumi in the job only for the lack of a
suitable replacement. And leadership credentials will be Japan's Achilles'
heel going forward. Still, none of Koizumi's economic reforms have
advanced substantively because the party's hardliners weren't willing to
risk theirs and the money mandarins' financial interests.
Koizumi has singularly failed to stabilise the chronic budget deficit
that has been buffeting Japan's financial sector since the bubble economy
burst in 1989. And the spectre of a bank-driven plunge still thickly
hovers. Fifteen years of economic indolence has put Japan's gross public
debts at over 150% of gross domestic product, and for years Koizumi sat on
his hands. That's not all. Years of Keynesian pump-priming measures
haven't worked either. And don't blame the Japanese for not spending the
income tax cuts they've been given since 1999; the LDP government has
failed to provide any clear sign of sustained economic growth.
A desperate Koizumi will roll back income tax cuts by half in 2006. The
other half will probably be purged in 2007. But his attempts to boost tax
revenue are anything but plain. What's clear, though, is that Japanese are
about to feel more pain. Take pensions: Koizumi managed to pass a law last
year that'll steadily raise national pension-fund premiums (which are
split between workers and their employers), from 13.58% of salary to 18.3%
in 2017. But wait: he'll also index pensions payouts to two vital
demographic factors - life expectancy and labour market growth.
The net effect of these moves will be that seniors' pensions will be cut
- wait for it - if people live longer than expected, or if fewer workers
are able to support them. What's more, Koizumi is banking on these
outcomes to cushion the effect on public finances. But if he keeps
slashing public spending, and takes away income tax cuts, where's the
spark for a languishing economy? Japan's export-led growth is a shadow of
its former self. More and more Japanese firms are relocating production to
lower-cost economies like China, Vietnam, Central Europe and South
America.
Koizumi is going to have one last roll of the dice, which will decide if
he quits or is tossed out by his LDP foes. Unlike Japan Post, whose
privatisation he has always advocated, Koizumi had backed away each time
from the politically vexing issue of upping private consumption sales tax
to boost the depleting government coffers. This year, it has risen by one-
third of a percentage point. It's mooted to climb by 1% next year, and by
a whopping 2.75% in 2007, taking it to about 7%.
But that depends on Koizumi surviving this year, although LDP rules
require him to step down by September 2006. That's far too long for the
cagey but powerful Ministry of Finance to wait; it wants to raise taxes
now. If Koizumi relents to LDP hardliners and the MoF, he may survive but
not the economy. A repeat of the 1997 disaster also hovers with just such
a move, which will stifle domestic demand ahead of any real economic
expansion. But if new taxes soar much higher as pension premiums rise and
tax rollbacks kick in, Japan's still recessed economy could easily slip
into another - and much longer - deflationary spiral. Either way, Japan
will have no winners.

"Crash deaths: Man charged with reckless driving (HL)
Source:New Straits Times
IPOH, Tues. - The 28-year-old driver of a car which ploughed into a group
of factory workers, killing seven and injuring two, was today charged with
reckless driving.
Chow Chung Neng, a supervisor at Seagate Industries (M) Sdn Bhd, claimed
trial to the charge under section 41(1) of the Road Transport Act 1987
which carries a maximum sentence of five years' jail or RM10,000 fine, or
both.
Magistrate Norsalha Hamzah fixed hearing for Sept 30.
The accident occurred between 7.15 and 7.30am yesterday when the women
were waiting at the roadside for a factory bus to take them to their
workplace. Six of the women died instantly, while the other died on the
way to hospital.
Those killed were Sodma Othman, 39, Kung Mooy Lan, 40, N. Subammah, 45,
N. Ramla Devi, 37, C. Valimah, 36, Rukibah Lop, 37 and Liew Ah Kan, 34.
The two survivors - Saadiah Rosli, 36, and K. Devi, 20 - suffered
fractured legs and are being treated at the Ipoh Hospital.
Saadiah who was four months' pregnant also lost her baby. She underwent
an operation at 3am today to remove her ruptured spleen.
Ipoh Hospital deputy director Dr Hardyal Singh said she was in stable
condition and had been warded in the Intensive Care Unit.
Dewi is also in stable condition.
Chow, who was arrested yesterday, arrived in court in a police van about
9.30 this morning and was led into court under heavy police escort.
Dressed in a white round collared T-shirt and dark blue jeans, Chow
appeared calm but tried to shield himself from a large number of
photographers and television cameramen who had waited since 8.45am.
Members of his family, including his mother who was in tears, pleaded
with cameramen to stop photographing him.
The charge was read out to him in Chinese at 11.30am and when he claimed
trial, Norsalha set bail at RM20,000.
Chow, who was unrepresented, appealed for a reduction but Norsalha
refused, saying that this was a case of public interest.
""This was a very serious accident which resulted in the deaths of seven
people and left two others injured. Bail will be set at RM20,000,"" she
said.
According to the charge sheet, Chow, of 72, Jalan Pengkalan Dua, Taman
Pengkalan Jaya, Ipoh, was said to have committed the offence about 7.20am
at Km9.5 Jalan Ipoh-Chemor while driving a car bearing registration number
WEJ 3493.
He was said to have driven the car in a manner which was dangerous to
the public, which led to the deaths of the seven women.
Chief Inspector Sarajit Singh prosecuted.
Members of the victims' families, whom the NST met today, were clearly
upset over the deaths and were disheartened by the charge under which the
driver would only face a maximum jail term of five years or a RM10,000
fine.
V. Sinniah, 54, who has yet to recover from the shock of losing his wife
Subammah and sister-in-law Rama Devi, said he had been informed of the
accident by his brother-in-law, N. Balu, at 9.30am.
He said he had three daughters, aged 20 to 26, the youngest of whom was
still at school.
Bus driver Tham Yee Chin, 44, whose wife Kung Mooy Lan was among the
dead, refused to comment when told of the charge.
Lorry driver R. Bathumalai, 47, when met at his house in Taman Klebang
Jaya was too distraught to speak about the accident which killed his wife
Valliamah.
She had given birth to a baby girl just five months ago. Their other
children include two boys aged seven and 14, and a 12-year-old girl.
""What is there to do, I lost my wife,"" he said.
Lamin Abdul Manap, 16, a Form Five student at Sekolah Menengah Megat
Khas, was greatly distressed by his mother Sodma's death. He said he was
an only child.
The sister of another victim, Liew Ah Kan, was very upset by her
sister's demise.
Two of the dead, Rukibah and Sodma, were buried today at the Gopeng
Muslim cemetery and Chemor Muslim cemetery respectively.
Suppamah and Rama Devi's remains have been taken to Sungai Siput for
burial this afternoon.
In Malacca, Inspector-general of Police Tan Sri Rahim Noor expressed his
frustration over the accident and the loss of lives despite strict law
enforcement.
""This is truly frustrating. I cannot understand, despite the strict
laws, why our drivers are still at it.""
He said the incident indicated that there were many ruthless and
inconsiderate drivers on the road.
""What can I say but express disgust over the whole thing?""

Asked if the police would propose that the laws be amended to provide
for stiffer penalties, he said the existing regulations were ""more than

"Speeding up public transport
Source:New Straits Times
JUDGING the state of public transport in the Klang Valley is easy: Take a
car trip into the city or its satellites at peak hours and see how well
you manage to fend off road rage. The conclusion is also easy to arrive
at: Kuala Lumpur needs better mass transit if its million or so denizens
are to stay sane. Providing an efficient system of trains, buses and taxis
in such a high-density environment, however, is much harder. Like most
instances of urban sprawl, congestion in the Valley has become a way of
life. New infrastructure, like the privatised LRT after the 1997 financial
crisis, creates new problems. Cities develop in so many unexpected ways
that planning becomes a continual headache. Governments with visions of
urban transport heaven, such as Britain's in the late 1990s, have had
their ambitions cut back to fit intractable realities.
Perhaps sobered by the unmet expectations of that decade's
infrastructure boom, Kuala Lumpur's transport policy-makers have chosen to
take it a step at a time. The first, and for now the most critical, is
""integration"" - bringing the gamut of private operators under the tent of
Inspak or the Klang Valley Integrated Public Transport System. Though
privatisation has been a boon, especially for construction, getting from
one place to another can involve confusing interchanges between
unconnected lines. If fractured routes are a disincentive, limited reach
is even more so. Most people would prefer the bus or train if stations
were nearer work and home. By owning and developing public transport under
a single authority, Inspak should be able to free the gridlock in the
Valley's services as well as expand the present network.
Yet there is a deeper issue here than the lack of centralised
organisation: public transport costs (and thus profit for the
concessionaires), which must somehow be met without penalty to its users.
Consequently, most cities have found that they simply cannot keep their
buses and trains running without subsidy - a dread word in the current
climate of low taxes and budget stringency. Raising the subvention,
usually through petrol and vehicle levies and parking charges, is a much
tougher challenge, and may prove as unpopular as it is inevitable.

"`Allow police to collect RM300 speeding fine on the spot'
Source:New Straits Times
KUALA LUMPUR, Mon. - Police may be empowered to collect the maximum fine
of RM300 for speeding on the spot from speedsters under a proposal to be
submitted to Datuk Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi.
Deputy Home Minister Datuk Chor Chee Heung said today that he would
raise the matter with the Prime Minister.
After visiting gunshot victims Tee Kim Lean and police constable Eruady
Saini at the Kuala Lumpur Hospital today, he said: ""I believe that by
imposing the maximum penalty of RM300 for speeding without any discount
will discourage errant drivers.
""The police have been too kind to speedsters by lowering the fines,"" he
said in response to the alarming number of accidents during the Hari Raya
season.
(On Thursday, Red Crescent volunteer Tee and two colleagues were
transferring a wounded suspect from a stretcher to a hospital bed when the
suspect grabbed a policeman's gun and fired four shots, inuring Tee and
Eruady).
Policemen should be allowed to issue receipts for the fines collected.
Chor said certain countries had implemented it with encouraging results.
Strict measures, he said, should be implemented to enforce existing laws
which he decribed as adequate to deal with road accidents.
Under amendments to the Road Transport Act 1987 implemented on April 18,
2000, those convicted of causing death by reckless or dangerous driving
will have to serve a mandatory jail sentence ranging from two to 10 years
and pay a fine of between RM5,000 and RM20,000.
Offenders will also be disqualified from holding or obtaining a licence
for a period of not less than three years from the date of conviction
while repeat offenders will be disqualified for 10 years.
Chor said the Prime Minister had also proposed the convening of a forum
on ways to check road accidents.
On the selection of the first batch of youth for the National Service
programme, he said balloting would be carried out next Monday.
Based on a recent meeting with the Defence Ministry, Chor said the
participants would be selected via computers at the Menara TH Selborn in
Jalan Tun Razak about 10am.
He invited representatives from various guilds and associations to
witness the balloting process. Nearly 84,000 youths are expected to take

I READ with despair your report (""Another fatal expressway crash in

interested in eliminating the loss of lives on expressways.
I have just returned from a trip to Muar.
On my way back, I had an express bus overtake me on the left lane of
the three-lane expressway, travelling at more than 110kph.
Warnings and threats by the authorities have not been effective, and
along with business greed, nonchalant drivers and short memories, we will
continue to read about such accidents in future.
With the progress of technology, the government should be able to
mandate the installation of speed governors on expressway buses, which
will limit the speed of the buses to 90kph on expressways, and sound a
siren if the speed of the bus exceeds the permitted limit.
The siren will inform other vehicle drivers that the bus is over the
speed limit.
These devices must be made tamper-proof, approved by Sirim, and
installed by Puspakom officers.
Is the government willing to do this?
Law enforcement is ineffective and bus owners and drivers could not
care less.
I would love to hear from others if there are other ways to protect
people from ""terrors"" on the expressways.

KLANG, Mon. - Selangor police have remanded seven drivers of commercial
vehicles for reckless driving which caused accidents resulting in deaths
during a two-week operation which began on Feb 16.
State Public Order and Traffic Chief Superintendent Zainal Abidin Rawi
said the drivers were remanded to facilitate investigation into the
accidents.
He said that if their recklessness and negligence were found to have
caused the deaths, the police would prosecute them.
He added in the operation - to nab owners and errant drivers of
commercial vehicles - police issued 1,522 summonses.
In Kangar, the magistrate's court today ordered a lorry driver who was
involved in a collision with a car to be remanded for seven days.
In the accident yesterday, a couple and their three-year-old daughter
were killed near Bukit Keteri.
Magistrate Najib Zakaria made the order to remand driver Saad Abdullah,
51, following a request by the Padang Besar district police.
Its traffic chief, Inspector Ibrahim Abu Bakar, said the suspect was
arrested when he came to lodge a police report three hours after the
accident.
""In his report, Saad said he decided to flee from the scene as he feared
being assaulted by the people.""
He said Saad could be charged with reckless driving under section 41(1)
of the Road Transport Act 1987 and, if found guilty, liable to a jail term
not exceeding five years or a fine not exceeding RM10,000, or both.

"Hit a home run

WHETHER it is playing baseball, burning rubber on the track or defusing
bombs, FAIZUL AZIM SAIFUL has it covered for the weekend.
MLB Power Pros
NEVER judge a book by its cover and in this case, don't judge MLB Power
Pros by the pictures on the cover, the cartoony graphics and the somewhat
goofy way baseball is played... this is a really cool game.
Look past the booblehead characters with big feet and no legs, or look
closely at their facial features and you might just recognise some of
your favourite players.
Yes, it is a parody of the sport but behind all that comical facade
lies a game that is quite deep and emphasises physical and statistical
realism that baseball gamers crave.
Those into baseball might even be pleasantly surprised by the realistic
stadium environments that the people at Konami had lovingly put together.
Yes, children will love it, but the gameplay has depth and the way the
ball flies off the bat needs to be seen to be believed.
The controls make it easy to place pitches and smash the ball. To throw
a pitch, you simply select it and position the cursor in the spot where
you want the pitch to go.
To swing, you just position the sweet spot of the bat in the strike
zone and press the button to swing. If you want, you can press a button
to toggle between hitting for contact and hitting for power.
Generally speaking, the ball will end up in play if the sweet spot is
anywhere close to the ball when it crosses the plate.
Of course, you can lay down bunts, set up steals, reposition the
defence, and make substitutions whenever you like.
The best part of this game is how it realistically simulates the
physics between the bat and the ball. How far you reach out, whether you
swing a little high or low, and whether your swing is early or late -
that's all factored into the ball's resulting trajectory.
Casual fans can pick their favourite players, teams, and stadiums in
the practice, home run derby, exhibition, and league modes.
But true-blue baseball fans can make their own players in the success
mode or create their own teams in the season mode and take them to the
top.
There's also a stand-alone edit feature that lets you quickly modify
existing players and teams, create new players, and put together fantasy
teams.
You'll earn points at the end of a game for you to spend at the store
to unlock alternate uniforms, additional player design options, and
cheats for use in all of the game's various modes.
This is a game with FUN written all over it. Don't be judgmental and
you might find yourself going batty after spending hours playing this
game. Definitely a home run.
Kick up the dirt
Sega Rally Revo
SEGA Rally Revo revs up the hand-held with some exclusive PSP tracks
set in exotic locations, gorgeous car models, challenging AI, fantastic
special effects and forgiving, yet functional controls.
Rally Revo has a wide variety of cars to choose from, most of which is
not lockable through the Championship series and each track comes with a
bar chart indicating the ratio of dirt, gravel and pavement, so choose
your tyres carefully.
Track designs are impressive and large, and have all sorts of
environments ranging from snow, sand, ice, and dirt, with all the
expected slipping and sliding around the tracks.
In the championship series, the environments are quite mixed up so
tyres that work well in one race might not be good on the next. So, keep
that in mind when you pick the tyres.
Like any arcade games, you'll always start at the back with the AI
shooting off to an early lead. You can usually overtake the first few
cars early on but the lead car takes more of an effort to overtake.
The environments are very well rendered with almost realistic details
and the trees, plants and crowd of spectators will definitely pull you
into the game.
The camera works exceedingly well whether you choose to drive from
behind, inside, or in front of the car. The hood camera is best as it
provides the best mix of view, control, and sensation of speed.
There is a lengthy series of races in the Championship mode but if you
want to just high-tail it into the action then the Quick Race and Time
Attack modes are just for you.
SEGA Rally Revo, with incredible graphics, intuitive controls, and a
fun casual design, really hits the spot when it comes to racing games on
the PSP. Kick up the dirt, take the corners and enjoy.
Ball of a time
BALLISTIC Wars, a game by local independent game developer Wan Hazmer
Wan Abdul Halim, his cousin Megat Daim Dziauddin and close friend Chen
Lee Nyin, won third place in the 4th Flash Game Design Competition, an
international class event, last week.
The trio had eight weeks to complete a game that revolves around ball
physics and a casual gameplay which could be played online.
Wan Hazmer said he got his inspiration playing pool, thinking that it
might be interesting to have different sized balls, terrain and traps in
the game.
""The idea was running around in my head and then they announced the
theme, so I called on Daim to do the character designs and animation, and
Lee Nyin to do the interface, and that was how Ballistic Wars was
created,"" said Wan Hazmer.
Ballistic Wars is a turn-based strategy game that uses ball physics to
plan your moves instead of the usual tiles. In the game you are in
command of an elite bomb squad, with you directing your various ""ball
units"" to strike bomb units physically to defuse them.
When it's the enemy's turn, the countdown of the bombs get lower. So,
the objective of the game is to defuse the bombs before their countdown
timers reach zero.

Singapore and Thailand to sponsor its future games.

RAUB, Fri. - A timber lorry driver pleaded not guilty in the magistrate's
court today to two charges of causing the deaths of two women in separate
accidents, including one which happened in 1996, by driving dangerously
and recklessly.
Marimuthu Subramaniam, 29, of Taman Raub Jaya, was charged with driving
his lorry in a dangerous and reckless manner causing the death of Siew
Yong, 47, yesterday at Km370, Jalan Kuala Lumpur-Kota Baru-Raub.
He was also charged with causing the death of Rapiah Hashim, 37, also by
driving in a reckless and dangerous manner, about 5pm on Oct 3, 1996, at
Km357, Jalan Raub-Kota Baru.
In both cases, Marimuthu was alleged to have driven his lorry
dangerously, thus causing the logs he was ferrying to fall on Siew Yong
and Rapiah respectively.
The charges under the Road Transport Act 1987 (amended 1999) carry a
mandatory jail term of not more than 10 years or a fine of up to RM20,000.
He can also have his driving licence suspended.
Marimuthu, who was not represented, pleaded not guilty to both charges
before magistrate Kamal Azirah Hassan.
Chief Inspector Noor Ariffin Mohd Nasir, prosecuting, applied to the
court to set bail at RM5,000 with one surety.
Kamal fixed Sept 6 for mention, thus giving time for Marimuthu to
appoint a lawyer.
In the accident about noon yesterday, Siew was waiting for her husband
in a car near a provision shop in the Teras town here when 10 logs from a
passing trailer driven by Marimuthu fell on the car and killed her on the
spot.
The husband had gone to send some groundnuts to the provision shop.
The chains which were holding the logs on the trailer were said to have
snapped when the trailer was negotiating a sharp bend, thus causing the
logs to crash onto the car while the trailer rammed into a provision shop.
Siew's body was removed from the wreckage by firemen from the Raub Fire
and Rescue Department who went to the scene after receiving a call about
12.06pm.
They took about 25 minutes to remove the body by using chainsaws to cut
up the logs.

Her judgment was read by Magistrate Teoh Chin Chong because Norashima is
on leave.
After the decision was announced, Teoh ordered Ho Yew Mei, 19, to
surrender his driving licence to the court.
Ho, of Kampung Baru Sungai Siput, was charged with driving a car
recklessly which led to the death of Leong Foo Sang, 19, at Jalan Sultan
Azlan Shah Utara about 11.15pm on Aug 2, last year.
He was charged in the magistrate's court here on Nov 25 and was granted
RM5,000 bail in one surety. No date has been fixed for the hearing.
Prosecuting officer Chief Insp Sarajit Singh had then submitted that it
was mandatory for the court to seize Ho's driving licence.
""The court should give the section a literal meaning since the law was
constructed by Parliament,"" he said.
Counsel G. Rama Naidu submitted that Ho was an assistant foremen and he
needed a car for his work. He added that the court had the discretion
whether to suspend his licence or not.

"Police blame speeding, dangerous driving
Source:New Straits Times
KUALA LUMPUR, Wed. - The first seven days of Ops Statik IV has shown a 32
and 26 per cent drop in the number of road crashes and death toll
respectively, compared to the corresponding period during the last
operation.
Federal Internal Security and Public Order director Datuk Abdul Hamid
Mustapha said today based on feedback, speeding and dangerous driving were
still the main causes of crashes.
He was speaking after the launch of a road safety campaign, jointly
organised by the police and Telekom Malaysia Bhd at the Gombak toll plaza.
The campaign, carried out as part of the ongoing Ops Statik IV, is aimed
at educating road users.
Also present was Telekom Malaysia executive director and chief operating
officer Datuk Dr Abdul Rahim Daud.
Abdul Hamid said last year 5,649 deaths were reported compared to 5,740
in 1998.
Meanwhile, Abdul Rahim said the campaign, which runs from Jan 5 to Feb
6, would entail sponsoring three signages bearing safety messages.
The signages, Awas - Anda Diperhatikan, Awas - Had Laju and Selamat
Memandu, will be placed at selected zones.
Telekom Malaysia will also be distributing car stickers, sun shades and
leaflets at major toll plazas during the campaign.

"2 years for reckless driving stays, rules court
PUTRAJAYA: Seven years ago, a construction worker was driving his car
with a friend along the trunk road to Jertih in Terengganu when he met
with an accident.
Somewhere near Kampung Padang Landak, Kamarulzaman Mat Salleh, 35, had
attempted to overtake a car.
He lost control of his car, hit a road divider and rammed into another
car parked on the opposite side of the road.
The impact caused Kamarulzaman's car to turn turtle. Kamarulzaman's
friend, Azlan Awang, 35, who was travelling with him, sustained serious
head injuries and died in the accident about noon on Feb 1, 2002.
Kamarulzaman was later charged at the magistrate's court with reckless
and dangerous driving.
In March 2003, the court found him guilty and sentenced him to two
years' jail and a RM5,000 fine.
The offence carries a maximum 10-year jail term and RM10,000 fine.
The High Court in Kuala Terengganu last December upheld the decision of
the magistrate and ordered Kamarulzaman to begin his jail term.
Yesterday, the Court of Appeal disallowed his application for leave to
appeal.
Judge Datin Paduka Zaleha Zahari, who sat with Datuk Hasan Lah and
Datuk K.N. Segara, said the question of law posed by Kamarulzaman lacked
merit. His counsel Datuk Shukri Mohamad had submitted that the conviction
was unsafe as all elements to prove the charge were absent.
Deputy public prosecutor K. Mangai submitted that the magistrate took
into account several factors, including the speed and manner with which
Kamarulzaman had driven his car.

"Summonses for speeding only through the mail
Source:New Straits Times
PETALING JAYA, Wed. - Motorists caught speeding will no longer be flagged
down to be issued with summonses but will instead receive them through the
mail.
This move is made possible following the commissioning of 44 new US-made
Laser Digi-Cam speed detectors which will take pictures of the speeding
vehicles with all the relevant data.
With the new speed detectors, police will gradually phase out the ageing
Falcon hand-held radar gun in service since 1987.
In disclosing this today, Federal traffic police deputy chief Assistant
Commissioner Dell Akbar Khan said traffic policemen had been informed
recently that they should stop issuing summonses on the spot.
""This is to prevent unnecessary argument and verbal abuse faced by them
each time they stop speeding motorists.
""With the new digi-cam, motorists will have no reason to argue as the
pictures of their cars including the date, time, place and vehicle speed
will be recorded on the film,"" he said.
If the motorists are still dissatisfied with the summonses, they can buy
a copy of the film for RM10.
He told reporters this after conducting a demonstration of the Laser
Digi-Cam in Jalan Lapangan Terbang Antarabangsa in Subang today.
The digi-cam detectors, manufactured by Laser Technology of Colorado,
USA, were purchased in two batches of nine in 1995 and 35 last December.
They were purchased at a price of RM7.8 million and have been
distributed to all State traffic branches in Malaysia, including 20 to be
used for the North-South Expressway and the Karak Highway.
They can be used in all weather condition, during day or night and has
an effective range of about 100 metres.
Policemen on duty can either opt to print the pictures on the scene of
the operation or store the data in a cartridge before processing the film
later. The cartridge can hold up to 980 frames.
Under the old system, policemen using the Falcon radar gun can only see
the vehicle speed being displayed on the radar gun before flagging down
the motorists and issuing them with the traffic summonses for speeding.
This will usually give rise to arguments as motorists will also deny
having gone over the speed limit.
While admitting that the 44 cameras would not be sufficient, Dell said
more would be purchased in stages.
""We will have to submit a request to the Treasury for this.
""But it is our intention to replace all the ageing radar gunsw by 1999.""
Dell said the new method of issuing summonses showed that police were
serious about nabbing speedsters without giving them any opportunity to
argue or dispute the allegation.
""We are not trying to find fault with motorists.
""Instead, we are trying our best to discipline motorists, which in turn
we hope will help bring down the number of accidents and deaths on our
roads,"" Dell said.
Eighteen traffic officers have been sent to Colorado to undergo training
at the manufacturer's plant and they will in turn train the other
policemen here.
He said an expert from the manufacturer would also be flown in soon to
conduct on-the-spot training for those handling the digi-cam detectors.

"Naeila bus driver jailed 30 months, fined RM3,000 for reckless driving
Source:New Straits Times
BATU PAHAT, Thurs. - The driver of a Naeila Express bus, which was
involved in a crash which killed four passengers early last year, was
sentenced to 30 months' jail by the magistrate's court today.
Abdul Jabar Kassim, 37, was also fined RM3,000 or three months' jail by
magistrate Mohammad Al-Saifi Hashim. His driving licence was also
suspended for 12 months. The sentence is effective from today.
Abdul Jabar, of Bandar Selesa Jaya, Skudai, Johor Baru, appeared calm
when the sentence was passed. His wife and child were also present in
court.
He was charged under Section 41 (1) of the Road Transport Act 1987 with
reckless driving, thus causing the death of four passengers on board the
express bus.
The offence was committed on Feb 13, last year, at Km15.5 Jalan Labis-
Yong Peng, about 7.30am.
Three of the passengers - Mohd Radzi Husain, 21, Ismail Abdullah, 59,
and Wan Mohamad Aliludin, 18 - died instantly while the fourth, Noor Azam
Mat, 32, died after admission to the Batu Pahat Hospital.
Another 13 passengers were injured in the incident, 10 of them
seriously.
Al-Saifi allowed an application by defence counsel Mary Jesmal Pereira
for a stay of execution pending an appeal to the Muar High Court.
He had earlier turned down an application by prosecuting officer Chief
Inspector Mohd Fudzi Mohd Ismail to have Abdul Jabar's present bail of
RM9,000 with two sureties raised.
During mitigation, Mohd Fudzi asked the court to impose a deterrent
sentence as the crash had claimed four lives.
He said a heavy sentence would be a lesson for Abdul Jabar as well as
other road users on the need to drive carefully.

Source:New Straits Times
KUALA LUMPUR, Tues. - City traffic police have since February detained 30
despatch riders who had been riding recklessly during their delivery
rounds in the Klang Valley.
Some of them were found to be involved in illegal racing on weekends.
Their machines were also without side-mirrors and proper lights.
The riders, aged between 19 and 35, were picked up during traffic
operations in various parts of the city between February and Sept 3.
City deputy traffic police chief Deputy Superintendent Tajol Ariff Ahmad
said they had received numerous complaints from motorists who were annoyed
by the daredevil antics of the despatch riders.
""These despatch riders simply weave in and out of the heavy traffic just
to deliver their consignments quickly without a thought for their safety.
""There has been instances whereby their actions had endangered the
safety of other road users especially pedestrians crossing road
junctions,"" he told a Press conference at the City Traffic Police
headquarters in Jalan Tun H.S. Lee today.
Tajol Ariff warned motorcyclists not to ride their machines recklessly
as under the amendments to the Road Transport Act, those detained for
reckless and dangerous driving were liable to a mandatory jail sentence of
between a day and five years, and a fine of between RM5,000 and RM15,000,
upon conviction.
Previously, offenders were fined not more than RM6,000 or sentenced up

"Speeding in rain among top causes of accidents
Source:New Straits Times
SUNGAI SIPUT: Speeding motorists, especially in rainy weather, have been
identified as one of the main causes of accidents along the East Coast
Highway.
The study by the Malaysian Highway Authority (MHA) and several other
parties identified tiredness, sleepy drivers and mechanical problems as
the other causes.
Works Minister Datuk Seri S. Samy Vellu said the study focused on 10
spots along the highway, which was opened on Aug 1, 2004.
He said ""water crossing"", noted at 14 locations, was also found as
another contributing reason.
To address this, Samy Vellu said median drains and pipe jacking had
been built to drain away water on the road surface.
The minister, who is also Sungai Siput MP, was speaking after
presenting Hari Raya goodies and duit Raya to 350 people here yesterday.
On plans to ban superbikes on highways, Samy Vellu said the
implications of such a move were being studied.
At the same time, he said the police would keep a close watch on the
group, and those flouting traffic laws would be issued summonses.
But, he said toll would not be imposed on superbikes, as suggested by
some parties.
Samy Vellu said the ban proposal was made in the interest of motorists'
safety and toll-paying highway users.
""I wanted to talk to superbikers but they were not in favour and only
issued statements to the press.""
Samy Vellu, who used to ride a Thunderbird 650cc in 1975, refuted
claims by superbikers that they could not use other roads.
""Many motorcyclists rely on federal roads. Road users have complained
that superbikers blocked the highways and refused to give way. They are
big-headed.""
The ban proposal has been slammed by superbiker associations.
They argued that forcing superbikers off highways would lead to more
accidents involving motorcyclists along trunk roads which had more
curves, poor road surface and bad lighting.

Universiti Teknologi Malaysia student Azuwan Dol, 19, of Jalan Raja
Alang, Kampung Baru, was sentenced by the magistrate's court to seven
days' jail and fined RM4,000 or four months' jail for riding his
motorcycle recklessly.
Azuwan, a second year student, pleaded guilty to committing the offence
at Jalan Semarang, about 6.15pm, on Sunday.
Magistrate Wan Liza Mohd Amin @ Fahmy ordered his jail sentence to begin
from the date of his arrest on Sunday and his licence be suspended for 18
months.
The facts stated that Azuwan was speeding from Jalan Raja Laut to Jalan
Tuanku Abdul Rahman and overtaking other vehicles. He had also failed to
stop at the red light of a pedestrian crossing.
When police officer Mustaffa Koyati, of the Jalan Tun H.S. Lee traffic

Abdul Rahman while conducting an operation against illegal racing with
several officers at Jalan Isafahan, behind the Sogo building, on Sunday.
Having seen Zubir, the group sped towards Jalan Raja Laut and Nor
Hanizam subsequently rammed into Zubir, knocking him down.
Nor Hanizam was then arrested by the other officers.
In mitigation today, Nor Hanizam - who was fined RM4,000 or six months'
jail in the magistrate's court on June 24 last year for reckless and
dangerous riding and also had his licence suspended for a year - asked for
a lenient sentence.
He said he had unintentionally knocked down the police officer while
avoiding the traffic which was congested at that time.
Prosecuting officer Chief Inspector R. Kumares however, pressed for a
deterrent sentence as the officer was injured as a result of Nor Hanizam's
actions.
Kumares said the case which had been highlighted in the media, had
sparked off public interest and urged the court to impose a sentence which
would serve as a lesson to the others.
Both Azuwan and Nor Hanizam paid the fine.
They were charged under section 42 (1) of the Road Transport Act 1987
which carries a maximum sentence of three years' jail or RM6,000 fine or
both upon conviction. They may also have their licences suspended for a
minimum of one year from the date of conviction.
In the case of a subsequent offence, offenders can be fined up to
RM10,000 or jailed five years or both upon conviction.
In the same court later, Englishman Alexander Michael, 24, was fined
RM1,800 or one month's jail for driving under the influence of alcohol.
Michael, of Villa Putra Condo, Jalan Putra Ismail, pleaded guilty to
committing the offence at Jalan Tun Razak, about 3.35am, today.
His alcohol content reached 147mg in 100ml of blood. The permitted level
is 80mg of alcohol in 100ml of blood. Michael paid the fine.

"30 days' jail and fine for reckless driving
Source:New Straits Times
KANGAR, Mon. - The magistrate's court today jailed a driver 30 days for
reckless driving, which resulted in him ploughing his 14-wheel trailer
into a group of Rakan Muda motoring expedition members two years ago.
Magistrate Faiz Dzaiyuddin also fined Zulkifli Omar RM7,000 or six
months' jail and suspended his driving licence for one year.
Zulkifli, 35, immediately notified the court through counsel Harmindar
Singh that he would appeal to the High Court.
Faiz ordered him to settle the fine today but stayed the order of
imprisonment.
The RM7,500 bail in one surety remains.
Zulkifli was charged with driving the trailer recklessly on the Kangar-
Alor Star trunk road about 12.30pm on Oct 19, 1996, causing the crash
which killed five expedition members.
The offence under section 41(1) of the Road Transport Act 1987 carries a
maximum jail term of five years or a fine of up to RM10,000 or both.
The victims were Mohamad Hafiz Yusof, 19, of Kepala Batas, Seberang
Prai; Reksut a/l Dinwichit, 24, of Baling, Kedah; Mohamad Azlan Awang
Kechik, 19, of Pinang Tunggal, Seberang Prai; and, Mohamad Azhar Abu
Bakar, 17, and Ahmad Fikri Daud, 20, both of Pantai Kamelong, Kepala
Batas, Seberang Prai.
The two-day expedition comprising 41 motorcycles was jointly organised
by the 4B Youth Movement of Padang Tembusu, Seberang Prai, and Perlis
Youth and Sports Department.
In pressing for a deterrent sentence, Deputy Public Prosecutor Abdul
Razak Musa referred to today's Press report quoting Works Minister Datuk
Seri S. Samy Vellu asking the Road Transport Department not to merely
suspend reckless drivers but to permanently bar them from driving.
The court should not develop a phobia against imposing a maximum
sentence if the situation warranted it, the DPP added.
He said that a clear signal must be sent to motorists, particularly
heavy vehicle drivers, to be more considerate of other road users, failing
which they would face court action.
In mitigation, Harmindar said Zulkifli had an unblemished record as a
driver and a custodial sentence would not be of any use.
He said Zulkifli, the sole breadwinner of a family with three young
children, aged between one and six, would have to find a new job if his
driving licence were suspended.

"Speeding up processes through multi-tasking
YOU urgently need to do a company or business search but dread the
traffic and parking woes that a drive to the Companies Commission of
Malaysia (SSM) office would entail.
No problem. Just log on to SSM's e-Info services and the information
you need is just a click of the mouse away.
What's more, the image of the documents submitted for the company's
incorporation or for the business to be registered is also available for
you to view or print via e-Info image.
With e-Info mobile, this information can even be obtained using your
mobile phone.
And with the SMS information service, you can check if a company or
business is duly registered by just messaging 32202.
SSM also allows a business to be registered within an hour compared
with three days in the past.
It used to take five days to incorporate a company. Now it can be done
within a day.
A business registration certificate can be renewed within 15 minutes
compared with an hour in the past.
It took five days to get a company name approved, but now it takes only
24 hours.
These are part of the government's efforts to facilitate business
growth by improving the public delivery system.
SSM chief executive officer Abdul Karim Abdul Jalil said he was
encouraged to cut red tape and make things simpler for the business
community after the setting up of Pemudah (the special task force to
facilitate business).
With more than 1,400 transactions per day, how did he manage to improve
the delivery system?
""It started with a re-look at our processes and discovering gaps and
weaknesses. We then decided to re-engineer our internal processes.""
This, he said, was done by shortening processes. For instance, a
three-step process was shortened to one.
""Previously, when a document was submitted at our counters, it was
piled up with other applications until there was a sufficient number of
documents to be sent to the back and checked by another officer.
""The checked documents would then be sent to another officer to be
processed.
""We have now cut down these processes. The document is sent straight to
an officer to be processed and this is done at the counter,"" he said.
Other steps included empowering front-line officers to approve
applications for business registration renewals and procuring additional
hardware such as printers to ensure there was no queuing up for
printouts, thus further cutting delays.
A disclosure-based system was also adopted.
""This means we treat whatever information you provide us as genuine
until proven otherwise,"" said Karim.
But the most important change, he said, was altering the work culture
of his staff.
""Multi-tasking was introduced and teamwork became a priority. There was
no longer such a thing as 'my work' or 'your work'.
""Now everything is attributable to SSM as an organisation.
""Overall, the process was as complex as a corporate restructuring
exercise which required extensive evaluation, re-engineering, execution,
as well as monitoring and upgrading.""
Although these measures were in place, Karim said many still had the
wrong perception of the SSM.
""A foreign participant at a seminar recently said it took more than two
weeks to incorporate a company in Malaysia.
""Fortunately, an SSM official was present and he asked the participant
when he had tried to incorporate a company here.
""When the participant said it was in 1996, the SSM officer told him it
could now be done within a day.
""Despite the wide publicity given to this, the majority of people do
not know the improvements made,"" he said.
As of Jan 14, there were 801,595 incorporated companies and 3,547,862
businesses registered with the SSM.
Karim said SSM handled an average of 151 company and 736
business-related applications daily.
To make life easier for consumers, SSM has also made Pos Malaysia its
agent so that renewal of business licences can be done at post offices.
On Malaysia being ranked 24 out of 178 on the World Bank's ""Doing
Business"" survey, Karim said the ranking, although comparatively good,
was based on inaccurate information.
""Most of the information received by the World Bank was from
correspondents in the country who were not aware of what we had done.
""We have engaged the World Bank's representatives and provided them
with accurate information.
""We have also published booklets explaining the changes that have taken
place in the public delivery system.
""It's better for them to deal directly with us than with third
parties.""
He said although much had been achieved, there was still a lot more to
be done.
""We look forward to delivering more improvements to the public and the
country in the next few years.""

"Motorcyclist seen speeding away
Source:New Straits Times
PETALING JAYA: A family of five perished in a fire which police believe
is a case of arson.
The victims were Leong Sun, 62, his wife Tan Lian Chee, 53, and three
children, Chew Choon, 14, Chiew Foong, 12, and Shuet Whey, 8. They were
believed to have died of smoke inhalation.
Five others who lived upstairs broke a window and jumped from the
double-storey house in Kampung Cempaka in the nick of time. The fire
broke out about 3am yesterday.
Police found a partially burnt towel dipped in kerosene outside the
house.
A neighbour, who woke up to the sound of breaking glass, said she saw a
motorcyclist speeding away from the house on Jalan PJU 1/30 about the
time the fire was spotted.
Police are interviewing family and friends to ascertain if arson was
indeed behind the blaze.
Christie Liew Ju Ann said she and her boyfriend Chow Chee Wai awoke to
shouts that a fire was raging.
Together with Chee Wai's parents Chow Wah and Chan Poh Yin, both 49,
and six-year-old brother Chow Mun Piew, they went downstairs where they
saw a huge fire.
""We knocked on the room door where the family of five was sleeping but
there was no answer. We even tried to break the door down but the intense
heat and smoke forced us to retreat upstairs.""
They then went into Chow Wah's bedroom, broke the window and jumped to
safety.
""We escaped in the nick of time as the bedroom went up in flames
moments after we jumped out of the window,"" Liew said.
Ong Sew Eng, whose double-storey house was also razed, said she had
been watching television when a firecracker-like sound startled her.
She came out to investigate and saw a motorcyclist speeding away.
Flames had also engulfed the entrance of the house next door.
""I started shouting that a fire had started to wake up my family.
Fortunately, we managed to get away,"" she sobbed, lamenting the loss of
her home of 23 years.
Ong, her husband and six children could not take anything from their
home as the flames razed it in minutes.
The Fire and Rescue Department received a call at 3.25am and a fire
engine arrived about three minutes later.
By 3.50am, the blaze had been extinguished but firemen had to wait more
than an hour for things to cool down before they found the bodies at
5.10am.
Four motorcycles and a car were also destroyed in the blaze.
Selangor assistant CID chief ACP Chee Cheng Wan said police had
recorded Ong's statement.
""Staff from both the Forensics and Chemistry departments went through
the ruins to look for clues.""
""All that was discovered was a towel which smelt of kerosene at the
entrance of the house. The case has been classified as arson,"" Chee said.
It has been learnt that the towel allegedly belonged to one of the
deceased. What is baffling is that the neighbour opposite Leong's house
did not hear any of the sounds Ong said she heard.

"Acquitted: Man charged with reckless driving
Source:New Straits Times
TELUK INTAN, Wed. - The magistrate's court today acquitted a research
officer with the Malaysian Agricultural Research and Development Institute
on a charge of reckless driving which resulted in the death of a cyclist.
Magistrate V. Santhiran said the prosecution had failed to prove Mahd
Mah @ Mohd Noh Jalal @ Jalil was the driver of the car at the material
time.
Mahd Mah, 44, had beencharged with driving his Mercedes Benz in a
reckless manner at the 2.5km Jalan Changkat Petai, Langkap-Tapah road, at
about 6.30pm on July 4, 1994. The alleged recklessdriving was said to have
resulted in the death of one Hashim Sharif.
The charge was under section 41(1) of the Road Transport Act 1987 which
carries a maximum sentence of five years' jail or RM10,000 fine or both.
Defence counsel V.T. Singam had submitted that the prosecution failed to
adduce evidence as to who was the driver of the car at the time of the
accident.
""There was also no evidence that Hashim died due to the accident as the
medical report shows the cause of death as fracture of the cervical spine
which had no bearing to the accident,"" he said.
Singam said the post-mortem and the Road Transport Department's reports
should not be admitted as evidence as the prosecution had failed to comply
with the provisions of Section 399 of the Criminal Procedure Code which
requires that a copy of the documents be served on Mahd Mah not less than
10 clear days before the start of the trial.
He urged the court to expunge the evidence from the records as they were
inadmissible.
Prosecuting officer Chief Inspector Ishak Arshad submitted that the
prosecution had succeeded in proving the charge although Sgt Abdul Rahman
Mohd Kuncu could not remember the date he served the documents on Mahd

THE Federal Criminal Investigation Department director wants to know how
two illegal gaming dens could have, in the words of the officer in charge
of the Sea Park area in Petaling Jaya, ""opened shop right under our noses""
and why the operators thought ""it was safe to operate near the police
station"". The OC attributed it to their ""cunning"". The cynical will leap
to the conclusion that it was because the policemen were on the take.
Whether they were just dull-witted cops outsmarted by clever criminals or
crooked cops whose palms had been greased, the incident puts a dent on the
reputation of the police.
It is because of the critical need to restore the image of the force and
to improve its crime-fighting capabilities that the Royal Commission on
the Police Force was set up last December. The commission had met with top
officers earlier this month because it felt the urgent need for the police
to act on complaints from the public rather than wait for the findings to
be completed. The Prime Minister concurs with this approach and wants
""practical and positive measures"" to be implemented as soon as possible.
There is indeed no reason why action on vital concerns should be delayed.
An important issue which merits attention are the allegations of
violations of human rights and civil liberties. Thorough investigations
should be conducted and action taken against those suspected of
mistreating suspects and detainees. Their legal rights must be respected
and conditions in the police lock-ups improved. To prevent beatings and
other forms of violence becoming standard detention and interrogation
practices, as few as such instances may be, a more stringent set of
operating procedures should be imposed. Public confidence will also
increase if improvements are made to the quality of counter service
provided at police stations. Paying a traffic fine or lodging a report
about a crime should not become an intimidating experience. Steps should
be taken to expedite the recording and investigation of reports. Fair
treatment of inmates on the one hand and efficient dealings with the
public are the two halves of the honourable profession of the police.

"Speeding: RM300 on-the-spot fine
Source:New Straits Times
PUTRAJAYA, Thurs. - Motorists committing serious offences including
breaking the speed limit and overtaking dangerously during the festive
season will have to pay on-the-spot fines of RM300 until Nov 25.
Joint police and Road Transport Department teams will also conduct
random checks on motorists to ascertain if they have outstanding summonses
or have exceeded the limit on Kejara points.
The Cabinet, at its meeting on Wednesday, decided that police and Road
Transport Department officers will not reduce the amount on any account.
The maximum fine will also apply to those found:
* overtaking where double lines are indicated;
* beating red lights; and,
* driving on the emergency lane.
Drivers of heavy vehicles using the fast lane will also not be spared.
Those unable to pay up will be charged in the nearest court on the next
working day.
Police and RTD officers have also been authorised to impound vehicles
without road tax or whose drivers did not have driving licences.
Special counters manned by police and Road Transport Department officers
have been set up beside road blocks nationwide where payment can be be
made.
Transport Minister Datuk Seri Chan Kong Choy, outlining ""stringent""
measures being implemented for the season, said motorists found to have
outstanding police and RTD summonses will have to settle all arrears.
He said police will also arrest those with outstanding warrants of
arrest and charge them in court immediately or the next working day.
He advised motorists to carry out online checks on whether they had
outstanding summonses or warrants of arrest against them.
Meanwhile, Deputy Federal traffic police chief Assistant Commissioner
Azizan Mohd Aras said traffic operation bases had been set up at Merapoh
along the East Coast Highway in Pahang, at Machap along the North-South
Highway in Johor and at Tapah in Perak.
He said police will open a few more bases over the next few days.
""Each base has a payment counter where the public can settle summonses.
For example, if motorists are north-bound on the PLUS highway, they can
pay it at the Tapah R&R area.""

"Judges told not to sacrifice justice in speeding up cases
Source:New Straits Times
PENANG, Thurs. - Judges should not sacrifice the principle of justice when
disposing of back-logged cases, particularly pre-2000 cases, Chief Justice
Tan Sri Ahmad Fairuz Sheikh Abdul Halim said today.
Ahmad Fairuz said the courts were now in the process of going through
the old files so that the cases could be heard soon.
""We will be calling all the parties concerned and ask if they intend to
resume their cases. If they do, we will then fix a new date for their
cases to be mentioned,"" he said.
Witnesses may have died or even forgotten about what had transpired
during the course of the incidents if their cases took too long to be
heard, he said after visiting the new High Court building at the Northam
Tower in Jalan Sultan Ahmad Shah. Also present were Penang High Court
judges Datuk Mohd Noor Abdullah and Datuk R.K. Nathan and Judicial
Commissioner Su Geok Yiam.
Ahmad Fairuz also reminded the judges not to neglect other criminal and
civil cases, particularly those that were of public interest, while
clearing back-logged cases.
""It is not true that other cases will be sidelined just because we are
working hard to dispose of old cases.
""I have emphasised to the judges that priority should be given to these
cases and I am glad that they are doing just that at the moment.""
He pointed out that the trial involving the murder of marketing
executive Noritta Samsudin and the rape-cum-murder of Canny Ong Lay Kian
had generated great public interest and were being given priority.
On his visit to the Penang courts, Ahmad Fairuz said he was pleased with
the speed, particularly that of the Butterworth and Penang courts, in
clearing cases.
""So far, more than 50 per cent of the pre-2000 year cases in Penang have
been cleared.
""However, Kelantan will be the first to achieve a 100 per cent clearing
record since the courts there have since last month completed 80 per cent
of all cases,"" he said.
Ahmad Fairuz said he was also briefed on the shortage of High Court
judges faced by the Penang Courts.
""They are supposed to have four High Court judges but are now making do
with only three,"" he said.

"On-the-spot fine for reckless driving stays (HL)
Source:New Straits Times
KUALA LUMPUR, Sat. - The RM300 on-the-spot fine for reckless driving
stays.
Waving aside the public outcry and comments on the legality of the fine,
Federal traffic police chief Datuk Gingkoi Seman Pancras said the instant
fine  would help  save lives.
""We are taking this action to ensure the safety of law-abiding citizens;
our ultimate aim is to save lives,"" he told the New Sunday  Times today.
Members of the public had expressed dissatisfaction when Transport
Minister Datuk Seri Chan Kong Choy announced  on Thursday that motorists
committing traffic offences during the festive season would be made to pay
an on-the-spot fine of RM300.
He said police would also arrest those with outstanding warrants of
arrest and charge them in court immediately or the next working day.
The instant fine applies to offences such as breaking the speed limit,
overtaking dangerously, overtaking at double lines, beating red lights,
driving on the emergency lane and driving heavy vehicles on the fast lane.
Bar Council chairman Khutubul Zaman Bukhari was quoted  yesterday as
saying that the move was illegal as motorists could not be arrested for
refusing to pay the fine immediately because they had the right to sort
out the matter in court.
Gingkoi said that Khutubul could have misunderstood the minister.
He explained that the arrest would only be made if there was an
outstanding warrant of arrest against the motorist.
""We (police officers) have no right to arrest someone for not paying a
small fine of RM300,"" he said.
""If they choose not to pay on the spot they can still go to court, but
they have to turn up on the stipulated date, or their vehicle will be
blacklisted.""
Traffic offenders who choose not to pay on the spot will be ordered to
appear in court on a date which will be decided by the court.
Gingkoi said the emphasis was on catching those who blatantly flouted
the law, reducing the accident death toll and protecting the law-abiding
citizen.
""If you are a careful driver you need not worry. This will only affect
those who break the law on the road.""
Gingkoi cited the case  of the family of four who were killed last week
near Slim River when a Mitsubishi Pajero rammed  them when  they alighted
from their car to change a punctured tyre along the North-South
Expressway.
""How could anyone be driving so fast on the emergency lane that he could
not stop in time?
""Those were senseless deaths caused by reckless driving and we want to
put a stop to this.""
On Kuthubul's allegation that the move was illegal, Gingkoi said: ""We
are certainly not breaking it.""
Meanwhile, Road Transport Department director-general Datuk Emran Kader
said those who felt the move was illegal could take the matter to court.

"All must keep their cool and put the brakes on reckless driving
Source:New Straits Times
IT'S an unfortunate fact: reckless driving is becoming as ingrained on our
streets as traffic jams.
Most Malaysian drivers have their own catalogue of near-disaster
experiences, and these ""I almost had an accident today"", tales have become
part and parcel of everyday conversations.
The authorities' growing frustration at the number of road accidents is
palpable, as seen by the Inspector-General of Police's recent declaration
that police would now detain all reckless drivers, even if there were no
resulting deaths or serious injuries.
Tan Sri Rahim Noor's statement made it clear that the police were
determined to beef up their arsenal against road daredevils, who
previously escaped detention if their antics had not killed or maimed
anybody.
The question, however, is how effective could such a measure be?
problem with moves such as making the process of obtaining a driving
licence longer and more difficult, launching media campaigns, creating the
""P"" driver system, and posting traffic policemen in key positions on the
roads throughout the recent double festival season.
Yet the carnage continues. Ops Statik, the nationwide traffic operation
that ended on Feb 8, recorded 338 fatalities in a stunning 12,294
accidents over 19 days, despite the police's best efforts.
It seems that short of positioning policemen along every stretch of road
all over the country, 24 hours a day, every day of the week, the Malaysian
road devil will continue to rule.
The public, meanwhile, rather than being moved to action by the daily
chronicle of death and suffering in the headlines and on the television,
appears to be getting desensitised to the ugly truth.
We shake our heads in dismay and then move on, resigned to the idea that
reckless driving has become part of the Malaysian culture.
The arrogance of the reckless driver's mentality is, in truth, part of
the Malaysian make-up.
It's based on an utter lack of courtesy and manifests itself in
different ways like the stampede to get on a bus and indiscriminate
littering. The only difference is that neither of these will get anybody
killed or crippled.
Reckless driving is in a class of its own, and a more insidious side to
this menace is its effect on law-abiding drivers.
Some in the latter group are developing callous driving styles
themselves, convinced that it's the only way they would ever get through
the madness on the roads and to their destination in one piece.
Nipping this arrogance in the bud will take more than the authorities'
increasingly heavy-handed and punitive measures, although their deterrent
effect is valuable.
The media campaigns and their tagline, ""Think of your loved ones"", is a
good start because they address drivers before they ever get on the road.
Datuk Lee Lam Thye, vice-chairman of the Malaysian Crime Prevention
Foundation, has also suggested taking this preventive measure a step
further by introducing road safety campaigns in schools.
Those who think that children are just too young to target are being
naive. They may not be driving licence-holders, but some children develop
a taste for daredevil road antics at an early age and have been known to
catch an illegal ride on their father's motorcycle.
Lee also urged making defensive driving courses available to all and
including road safety lectures in occupational safety and health
programmes.
As for the public, it's time to shed its preferred passive stance.
When contacted yesterday, Lee said he wished the public would act as
extra eyes for the police so that more reports could be lodged against
reckless drivers.
The very least that everyone could do is keep their own cool when they
themselves are faced with the temptation to break the law on the road.
All the enforcement and campaigning in the world will come to naught if
one moron's place is immediately taken by another.

"Hit-and-run fun with the Simpsons
Source:New Straits Times
Title: The Simpsons Hit & Run
Developer: Radical Entertainment
Publisher: VU Games
Available: The Software Boutique (Tel: 03-78763818)
Price: RM139
OVER the years of American television comedy series, we have seen
numerous comedies come and go. But one comedy, which also happens to be a
cartoon, has stood against the test of time. Its dark but hilarious
content revolutionised how modern cartoons are made, thus spinning off
several similar adult-oriented cartoon comedies like Beavis & Butthead and
South Park. One of the longest running comedies of all time: The Simpsons.
It's been about 15 years since its weekly TV debut, but who can ever
forget the side-splitting and riotous moments Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and
baby Maggie brought to our living rooms every week.
Throughout the years, there have been more than a dozen video games that
have carried the licence of the Simpsons franchise. Now, the most
dysfunctional family in town of Springfield is back with a brand new game
aptly titled as The Simpsons Hit & Run!
The game was released on all three console platforms by VU Games earlier
this year.
After playing the game through, it's no wonder that VU Games released
the game on the Xbox, PlayStation 2 and GameCube first before porting it
to the personal computer (PC) as it is a very console-minded type of game.
As a matter of fact, the game borrows heavily from another successful
console-to-PC port, the Grand Theft Auto series, but minus the
controversial acts of violence that one has to commit in order to succeed
in that particular series. So, The Simpsons Hit & Run is a dream come true
for underaged kids whose overprotective parents object to their playing of
the Grand Theft Auto series.
To gamers who already think that this game is for kids below 12, well,
think again. The usual sharp humour and unique personality of the world of
Springfield is still there, and expect the customary banter between Homer
and Bart to leave you in stitches.
The Simpsons Hit & Run begins when robotic bees, mind-controlling cola
and mysterious black vans start besieging the town of Springfield. Soon
enough, Homer's curiosity gets the better of him and he starts
investigating the origin of all these strange happenings around
Springfield.
You will start as Homer for the first level, and soon switch characters
among Bart, Lisa, Marge and even resident Kwik-E-Mart proprietor, Apu!
There are a total of 56 missions of mayhem for gamers to play in. The game
uses a basic-level structure with seven total levels, each character with
seven primary missions.
Each level in the game is assigned to one specific character. The first
mission, as stated earlier, is for Homer. Lisa, Marge and Apu only get one
level each while the more popular characters - Bart and Homer - get two
missions each.
Each level has a bonus mission and three non-plot-related race missions.
Gamers are not required to complete these missions as they're only there
to be ""distractions"" for gamers when they can't finish a particular
compulsory mission.
In actual fact, these mini-missions are like side dishes for the main
course. But when gamers take the trouble to complete the bonus missions
and race missions, you'll unlock new and unique cars in the game.
Some gamers might think it's not important to play these mini-missions,
but new and improved vehicles are vital to one's success in completing the
game. So, take some time to play these missions to get cool vehicles like
Professor Frink's futuristic hover car!
Similar to the Grand Theft Auto series, you'll need vehicles to get
around Springfield. Bluntly put, practically every mission in the game is
a direct clone of the Grand Theft Auto series' driving missions.
As stated earlier, The Simpsons Hit & Run is void of any violence that
the Grand Theft Auto series is infamous for. To cater to the younger
generation of gamers, a self-imposed ban on weapons and other dangerous
equipment is made by the game developer. This means every character is
only limited to kick attacks, regardless whether you're playing as a
disgruntled Homer or sweet Lisa.
For the first few levels, you'll feel there's a disappointing lack of
variety in attack options, but going slowly into more difficult missions,
you'll realise that a game does not need to rely on violence to be
enjoyable. The Simpsons Hit & Run clearly shows that games can rely on
clean but entertaining gameplay in order to attract gamers.
While the game performs up to expectation in almost every major
department, The Simpsons Hit & Run fails in one of the most vital aspects
of any console-minded game - the camera angling system.
When you're driving around, the camera angle is fine in all three
available camera views. On the other hand, when you're walking around
town, the camera seems to bug out randomly. This is especially common when
you stand too close to a building.
Clipping is also a problematic area in the game, especially when you
stand too close to destructible or constantly moving objects.
However, despite the camera angling problems and the lack of originality
in the game's missions, The Simpsons Hit & Run is saved and more than made
up by the decisively original style of The Simpsons' humour. The end
result is fun for gamers of all ages.
The Simpsons Hit & Run is really for all Simpsons-loving fans, and those
who enjoy games with witty and undeniably hilarious jokes.

BREAKING THE LAW AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHER ROAD USERS ... These pictures
clearly showed the scant respect for the law among motorcyclists, whose
reckless driving habits are not only endangering their lives but also
those of other road users.
The pictures were taken by the New Straits Times photographer P.C. Lim
along Jalan Ma'arof, beside the junction near Jalan Telawi Empat, in
Bangsar.
Despite the double-line and no-right turn sign, motorists and especially
motorcyclists take the risk to turn into Jalan Ma'arof from Jalan Telawi
Empat or vice-versa.
When the NST team surveyed the area yesterday, many motorists were found
to flout the traffic rules.
During a 30-minute watch from 1.30pm, 32 motorists, including
motorcyclists, were spotted crossing the double line.
An office worker said there had been several accidents at the spot.

"Comatose woman may be hit-and-run victim
Source:New Straits Times
GEORGE TOWN, Thurs. - A 56-year-old woman is fighting for her life in
hospital here amid speculation as to what actually happened.
Her grieving family believes she was a snatch theft victim, as she had
been on two occasions several years ago. The police say evidence gathered
so far pointed to a hit-and-run case.
State police chief Deputy Commissioner Datuk Christopher Wan Soo Kee
said initial investigations revealed there was nothing to prove Khoo Poh
Kim was a snatch theft victim as her handbag and other belongings were
intact.
""I have instructed my officers to examine Khoo's badly damaged
motorcycle,"" he told reporters after visiting the victim at the Lam Wah Ee
Hospital intensive care unit.
The comatose Khoo, who suffered severe head injuries, is in a critical
condition. She has undergone two operations since her admission.
Khoo was found sprawled beside her motorcycle at the Bukit Dumbar
flyover at 6.30pm on Tuesday. She was in a semi-conscious state and
clutching her handbag tightly. Hospital authorities lodged a police report
on Khoo's condition yesterday.
Wan said police were waiting to record her statement. He urged witnesses
to come forward and help in investigations.
He expressed disappointment that the tow-truck operators had failed to
obtain prior approval from the police before towing away Khoo's
motorcycle. This, he said, had resulted in the evidence being compromised.
Khoo's nephew, Kelvin Goh, 26, said the family would co-operate with the
police in their investigations. Speaking in between sobs, he said he had
every reason to believe his aunt was a snatch theft victim.
He said doctors had told him she may suffer a memory lapse or speech
disorder when she recovers.

which crashed along the North-South Expressway, killing six people, was
charged at the magistrate's court yesterday with reckless driving that
caused death.

amount to be reduced, saying he could only afford RM4,000.
""I have four other children to support,"" he said.

"'Hand belonged to hit-and-run victim'
KAJANG: The mystery of the hand found in a Petaling Jaya drain on
Wednesday has been solved.
It belongs to an Orang Asli teenager whose right hand was severed in a
hit-and-run accident near Ulu Yam, Gombak, three days earlier.
Selangor police chief Datuk Khalid Abu Bakar said the motorist crashed
into the 14-year-old's motorcycle about 5.30am on Sunday.
""The 26-year-old driver panicked when he found the severed hand in his
car five hours later and threw it into the drain near his home.
""The suspect was arrested on Thursday and has been charged with fleeing
from an accident scene and trying to dispose of evidence,"" he said.
It was reported that a passer-by found the hand in the drain in front
of a kindergarten in Taman Sri Manja about 10.30pm.
The boy was treated at Kuala Kubu Baru Hospital and has been discharged.
Khalid was speaking yesterday after presenting the 2007 Best Police
Station award to Kajang police station.
The station was chosen because of the services it provided to the

"Quarry worker pleads not guilty to reckless driving
Source:New Straits Times
SIK, Mon. - The driver of a car which ploughed through a crowd at a pasar
malam in Jeneri last Wednesday, killing three people and injuring 14
others, today pleaded not guilty to a charge of reckless driving.
Ooi Ah Ba @ Ooi Ah Han, 56, a quarry worker from Gurun, was allowed bail
of RM35,000 in one surety by magistrate Sharul Rizal Majid pending hearing
on Oct 13.
He is charged under Section 41(I) of the Road Transport Act, 1987 and
faces a maximum of five years' jail, a fine not exceeding RM10,000 or
both.
Sharul Rizal, who on Saturday fixed bail of RM40,000 in two sureties
pending mention of the case today, reduced the bail amount to RM35,000
following an application by Ooi's counsel Tay Chai Huat.
However, he could not post bail. Ooi was charged before Sharul Rizal in
the Baling magistrate's court on Saturday but no plea was recorded as Ooi
did not understand the charge which was read to him in Bahasa Malaysia by
a court interpreter.
When the charge was read to him in Hokkien, Ooi claimed trial.
In applying for a reduction in the amount of the bail, Tay told the
court that Ooi suffered high blood pressure and was being treated at a
private hospital in Sungai Petani.
He claimed that his client had suffered a mild stroke during the
incident and was not driving under the influence of alcohol.
Sharul Rizal said the bail was appropriate as three people had been
killed while the fate of 14 others was still uncertain.
He said the accused, knowing that he had high blood pressure, was not
only exposing himself to danger but also the lives of others when he chose
to drive.
Ooi is accused of driving his car recklessly and causing the death of
three people and injuring 14 others along Jalan Simpang Tiga, Kampung
Masjid, Jeneri, Sik at 6.15pm on Wednesday. In the incident, Mohd Farid
Abdul Ghani, nine, Nor Aishah Abdul Halim, 13, and Mek Som Ismail, 68,

"Hit-and-run at sea

PORT KLANG, Tues. - Fisherman Neim Ahmad saw the shadow of death, then
came a splitting crash and he and his son were in the sea.
The ship that had cleaved their vessel in two sped on, oblivious to the
humans bobbing in the waters, shouting for help.
""When the ship came towards us, I prayed I would live to see my wife
and 13 children again,"" Neim recalled today.
It was 10pm on Sunday when Neim, 53, and his son Norizan, 30, stared
death in the face. They held on to parts of their fishing boat. Sailors
on several ships saw them but did not stop, said Neim.
The rescue came at 12.30pm yesterday when the crew of the oil tanker MT
Triple Joy plucked them out of the sea.
Recalling the harrowing incident, Neim said he and his son had left
their village along Sungai Melaka, Malacca, in their 12m fishing boat
about 4pm on Sunday.
""We had cast the nets and were resting about five nautical miles off
the coast near Pulau Undan. Just before 10pm, I wanted to mix a hot drink
for us. As I was waiting for the water to boil, I noticed the lights of
an approaching ship but its path seemed to be away from our position.""
Neim said he paid no attention to the ship but moments later, he saw
the ship heading directly towards them.
""I shouted to my son to watch out as the ship slammed into the boat,
which then split in two.
""When in the water we clung to wood from the boat and shouted for help
but the crew did not seem to hear our cries as the ship never stopped.""
He said Norizan kept going underwater.
""I got hold of him and we swam towards a large section of the boat's
hull and managed to climb onto it. Then we waited for help.""
Met at Westport this afternoon, father and son looked well. But Neim, a
fisherman for 30 years, said: ""I am afraid of going out to sea again.""

"Reckless driving: Mixed reaction to stiffer penalty
Source:New Straits Times
KUALA LUMPUR, Thurs. - The Government's decision to review the punishment
against reckless drivers, including the introduction of mandatory jail
sentence, has received mixed reaction.
Although many expressed support for harsher punishment, reservations
were also voiced regarding the introduction of the mandatory jail
sentence.
Some felt existing laws were already adequate but lack proper
enforcement.
Transport Minister Datuk Seri Dr Ling Liong Sik said yesterday that his
Ministry will discuss amendments to the Road Transport Act 1987, following
the Cabinet's directive which was prompted by the increasing number of
deaths in road accidents.
Pan Malayan Road Transport Operators Association executive secretary
Teoh Phaik Lean said the association was in favour of a more preventive
legislation against reckless drivers.
She, however, expressed concern over the assumption that large vehicles
are the main culprits of the increasing number of road accidents and,
therefore, should be the main target of such legislation.
""The legislation should cover everyone and not only drivers of heavy
vehicles, such as lorries and express buses, because the recently
highlighted accidents involving them are still comparatively low compared
to other vehicles.""
On the proposed mandatory jail sentence, Teoh said it was for the
Government to decide but expressed her hope for the legislation to be
carried out with proper care.
Express Nasional Bhd general manager Hassim Dollah  said the
introduction of harsher legislation will only have a temporary desired
effect because it will not solve the ""root of the problem"".
""The mandatory jail sentence may scare drivers at first but old habits
die hard and sooner or later they will revert to their former reckless
selves.""
Lawyer K. Belaguru said harsher punishment for reckless drivers was
needed following the rise in fatalities in road accidents.
""It is, however, necessary for the legislation of such mandatory jail
sentence to be done by not taking away the discretion of the court such as
by imposing limitations in delivering the sentence for the period of
imprisonment.""
Lawyer Christopher Fernando disagreed with any legislation of mandatory
nature which he said eroded the discretionary capacity of the courts.
""We should welcome a harsher punishment against reckless drivers but to
pass a panic legislation especially of mandatory nature is not going to
solve the problem.""
As an alternative, Fernando suggested that the Transport Ministry look
more into its own existing problems in enforcing the existing law which he
described as adequate in tackling the problem.

"Speeding up app traffic
Source:New Straits Times
IN Malaysia, more business than ever is done at local branch offices and
remote sites, but fewer and fewer IT resources are hosted there.
Applications are being consolidated - sometimes centralised, sometimes
outsourced.
But in many cases, a consolidated application translates to a poorly
performing application. Long distances between users and applications,
latency-prone network pipes, and applications and protocols stretched
beyond their design limits mean poor application performance at remote
sites.
These issues are made more complex by the introduction of additional
bandwidth-hungry, latency-sensitive applications such as voice over
Internet protocol and video.
The industry response is predictable: accelerate the traffic. While
appropriate at a high level, the rush to a solution has left out some
important questions. For example, should everything be accelerated? If
not, which applications are key? What about encryption?
Acceleration technologies range from compression to caching to bandwidth
management and protocol optimisation. All of these techniques have
benefits, but for a given application, some improve performance more than
others.
Most organisations need all of these techniques for the array of
applications deemed important to the business (file services, e-mail,
secure Web, video), but what about the countless ""applications"" that run
on the enterprise network that are not business-related or worse, harmful
to the business? Given that 30 per cent of enterprise network bandwidth is
consumed by unauthorised applications (Web advertisements, inappropriate
Web surfing, peer-to-peer software, spyware, etc), removing the
undesirable can be as important as accelerating the desirable.
Options. Organisations have several options to address these issues.
They can upgrade their wide area network (WAN) circuits to higher
bandwidth links, which is rather expensive, or choose to ignore these
performance issues - resulting in employee dissatisfaction and more
importantly, broken applications and impeded business processes.
There is another option: accelerate the traffic. Not surprisingly, this
is the option that many organisations are now looking at. Available
acceleration techniques include:
* Bandwidth management or traffic shaping: This technique assigns a
priority to a particular application's (or user's) traffic. This priority
has an effect in both the order the traffic is sent and the amount of
bandwidth the traffic is afforded. While this technique does not make
traffic go any faster on the network, it does make sure that the network
is available first for the highest-priority traffic.
* Protocol optimisation: This technique takes protocols that are
inefficient over WAN and makes them more efficient, typically by
parallelising traditionally serialised communications. There are other
optimisations, depending on the protocol (for example, transmission
control protocol/TCP session reuse) that can make starting up or tearing
down flows faster. These optimisations do not reduce the amount of
bandwidth an application consumes, but can greatly accelerate applications
(for example, reduce latency) - the longer the WAN link, the greater the
improvement.
* Byte caching or dictionary compression: Byte caching is, as its name
suggests, a low-level cache of small, sub-application object pieces of
information. Typically, byte caching schemes observe repetitive patterns
moving between two caches in application traffic, symbolise those patterns
with a token, and send the token instead of the bulky traffic - tokens
being typically a byte or two, symbolising large blocks (for example, 64
kilobytes). The cache on the far end matches the token with the original
block of data, reconstitutes the traffic, and sends it on to the
application or user (whichever is appropriate). Byte caching is typically
not application-specific and operates at a lower level, reducing bandwidth
of all TCP traffic.
* Object caching: Object caching is very different from byte caching in
that it is protocol or application-specific and an all-or-nothing affair.
If the cache contains the object, the user is served the object from a
local store - quickly. Object caching, on a ""cache hit"" (which is where
the object has been through the cache and then stored), reduces greatly
the bandwidth used and latency. If the cache does not contain the object
(or contains an outdated version of the object), then for that particular
transaction, object caching does nothing (although the next time that
object is requested, it will be fast).
* Compression: This technique uses a common compression algorithm to
remove extraneous or predictable information from the traffic before it is
transmitted. The information is reconstituted at the destination based on
the same algorithm. It is important to note that there is no
synchronisation between the two ends - and the first time something goes
through is just as fast as the second. This technique reduces the data
transmitted over the WAN link but has limitations on how much bandwidth
reduction it can achieve by itself, and has minimal impact on latency.
EVALUATION. Organisations should have a strategy for evaluating
different acceleration techniques. First, they should prioritise
applications that need acceleration.
Second, they should examine each application (and its parent initiative)
in detail to assess the faults within that application, understand the
best acceleration techniques for that application, and best bring those
techniques to bear.
Third, they should examine the trends, both in the application mix (for
example, Web, in-house versus third party-hosted, or hypertext transport
protocol secure) and networking architecture.
Finally, they should establish non-application-specific overall solution
criteria - deployability, manageability, reliability and solution breadth.

PENANG, Wed. - A taxi driver got the shock of his life when he was booked
for speeding along the North-South Expressway at 1,120km per hour!
""I must have been flying then,"" Abdul Rahman Ismail said.
""It's simply incredible that I could have gone that fast and that the

As stated in the summons, the incident allegedly took place at Km130.2
of the Expressway at 9.34am on Aug 5, last year.
Rahman, of Taman Ria in Sungai Petani, Kedah, was alleged to be driving
a taxi bearing the registration number KAX 3891.
He said he would check with the Seberang Prai Utara district police
headquarters over his alleged offence.
Asked whether he drove the taxi at the time of the alleged offence,
Rahman said he could not recall.
""Even if I was speeding then... At 1,120km per hour?""
Meanwhile, deputy State chief police officer Datuk Abu Kassim Md Noor

This morning, they were brought to the magistrate's court for mention of
their cases but the cases were postponed to next month to enable the
prosecution to amend the investigation papers to be in line with the
amendments.
They will be charged under Section 42(1) of the Act with reckless and
dangerous driving which, following the amendment, carries a mandatory jail
sentence of between a day and five years, and fine of between RM5,000 and
RM15,000.
A source said the 14 youths, including a Form Five pupil, were detained
at Jalan Bangsar, Jalan Raja Laut, Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman and Jalan
Ipoh.
""They were sent to the court this morning, but the presiding magistrate
instructed the police to re-submit the paper, using the new amendments
before postponing the case to next month,"" the source said.
The 14 youths were released on bail.
The new amendment which came into effect on April 18, also hands out a
severe penalty to motorists guilty of causing death or injury while drink
driving - a mandatory jail sentence of between three and 10 years and fine
of between RM8,000 and RM20,000.
Those convicted of causing death as a result of reckless or dangerous
driving (section 41 of the Act) will have to serve a mandatory jail
sentence ranging between two and 10 years and a fine of between RM5,000

Offenders will also be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving
licence for a period of not less than three years from the date of
conviction while repeat offenders will be disqualified for 10 years.
The amendments, tabled in Parliament last year, involve eight sections

"Speeding up large file transfers
Source:New Straits Times
ARE you constantly struggling with slow transfer of large files over wide
area networks (WANs), even after adding extra bandwidth? If you are, then
US-based Riverbed Technology Inc may be able to help you.
The company has announced three new appliances, namely Steelhead 5520,
Steelhead 6020 and Interceptor 9200, which it claims can improve
performance across WAN and save bandwidth for all transmission control
protocol (TCP)-based applications such as e-mail and Lotus Notes.
Its technical marketing director Joshua Tseng pointed out that the three
root causes of poor application performance over WAN are inadequate
bandwidth, transport protocol inefficiencies and application protocol
inefficiencies.
""With this in mind, our solutions eliminate redundant data on the WAN,
thus boosting bandwidth performance and giving users faster access to
large files,"" he said.
The Steelhead 5520, for example, delivers optimised WAN bandwidth of up
to 155 megabits per second and 800Mbps when the disk-based data reduction
function is disabled.
This model supports up to 15,000 simultaneous TCP connections (supports
up to 4,000 remote users) and has a disk capacity of 1.5 terrabytes and a
data storage of 700 gigabytes (GB).
Meanwhile, the Steelhead 6020 delivers up to 310Mbps and 800Mbps when
the disk-based data reduction function is disabled. This model supports up
to 40,000 simultaneous TCP connections (supports between 8,000 and 10,000
remote users) and has a disk capacity of 3.2TB and a data storage of
1.4TB.
The Interceptor 9200 supports up to a million simultaneous TCP
connections per cluster (supports between 200,000 and 300,000 remote
users) and up to four gigabits per second (Gbps) of optimised WAN
throughput.
Designed for large offices, financial service institutions and data
centres, all three models are bundled with Riverbed Optimisation System
(RIOS) version 3 software that offers features like network file system
(NFS) application streaming.
The software also includes new optimisation for the common Internet file
system (CIFS) protocol that improve the performance of collaborative
applications such as Visio and SolidWorks by up to 20 times.
RIOS also supports quality of service (QoS) enforcement for all traffic
types, including TCP, voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) and video.
Support for QoS allows organisations to manage their real-time
applications such as voice and video traffic.
""Riverbed's QoS enforcement allows administrators to set policies based
on latency and bandwidth. This means the administrators can prioritise
latency-sensitive traffic such as voice and video without the expense of
over-allocated bandwidth,"" Tseng said.
Riverbed products are distributed by M.tech here.

people and injuring 17 others yesterday.
The 50-year-old driver denied allegations that he was speeding prior to
the accident which took place along the Simpang Pulai-Kampung Raja road
near here.
Speaking to reporters at the Ipoh Hospital today, Shah said the third
gear was engaged when the accident occurred.
""It is impossible to exceed 40km/h in third gear as the engine would
overheat.""
He also reiterated that he lost control of the bus due to brake failure.
Shah said the 2.30pm accident would have occurred earlier if he had been
speeding.
He also said he would ""fight"" for his right if charged with reckless
driving saying: ""I will not plead guilty as I was not speeding!""
Shah, whose right arm was crushed in the accident, did not speak to
reporters earlier because he was wearing an oxygen mask.
But he quickly removed it to give his side of the story when a woman,
believed to be his wife, was asked whether he was speeding.
It is learnt that the bus had brushed a concrete divider and jumped over
a large drain before rolling into a 30-metre-deep ravine.
Shah, who has been driving buses since 1975, said the bus company
(Ekspres Kurnia Bistari) should also be blamed as the bus was not equipped
with air brakes.
""Buses plying hilly routes such as Cameron Highlands and Genting
Higlands should be equipped with air brakes.
""Normal brakes usually overheat and fail to function due to the constant
braking.""
The bus company officials could not be contacted for comment.
Meanwhile, a passenger who was seated behind the driver's seat, Fredicka
De Groot, 32, told the New Straits Times the bus only picked up speed a
few minutes before the accident.
""Everything happened so fast. The driver did not shout any warnings to
us and the only thing I heard was him saying `Ah, Ah, Ah' before the
accident,"" she said.
She injured her spine while her husband Hans, also 32, broke his right
leg.

"Manager on trial for reckless driving
Source:New Straits Times
GEORGE TOWN, Thurs. - The trial of a bank manager charged with reckless
driving causing severe injuries to Bukit Gelugor Member of Parliament
Karpal Singh began today.
Two witnesses testified at the magistrate's court today, including
airport limousine chauffeur Soid Abdul Ghani, 50, and police photographer
Lance Corporal Mohd Fauzey Abdul Rahman.
Soid related how the accident had occurred as he was about to turn into
Karpal's Jalan Utama residence about 12.15am on Jan 29 last year.
He said the car was pushed forward almost 10 metres after being hit
from behind. He was in a state of shock and saw Karpal lying in the back
seat and crying out in pain.
Soid, who has been a chauffeur for almost 10 years, said Karpal boarded
his limousine at the Bayan Lepas International Airport about 11.45pm.
Soid said he reached the road to Karpal's house about 12.15am and he
turned on his right indicator about 50 metres from the latter's driveway.
""I then applied the brakes and was waiting to execute a right turn when
I suddenly heard a loud bang at the back and my car lurched forward.
""I saw a silver Proton Waja had crashed into my car,"" he said, adding
that the road where the accident occurred was wide enough for two cars to
travel alongside each other.
Soid said a man got out of the car looking downcast and disoriented.
He said Karpal's wife and their son, Jagdeep Singh Deo, arrived at the
scene soon after and Karpal was rushed to a medical centre in an
ambulance.
Bank manager Lay Yee Fuat, 44, is charged with driving a car recklessly
in Jalan Utama about 12.15am on Jan 29, 2005.
The offence under the Road Transport Act carries a maximum one-year
jail sentence or a fine of up to RM10,000.
It was reported that Karpal, 66, suffered neck and spinal injuries in
the accident.
He has undergone physiotherapy at Kuala Lumpur Hospital and a private
clinic.
The DAP chairman has been confined to a wheelchair and is still
undergoing intensive treatment. Hearing continues on April 6.

"Speeding up broadband
Source:New Straits Times
IT used to be just about living longer and healthier. But in the
technological age, the progress of nations is measured initially by TVs,
fridges and telephones, and after such essentials are commonplace, by how
easy it is to hook up to the Internet. Not just access, mind you, but
fast connection speeds. Malaysia's broadband household penetration rate
looks decent at first glance, at least according to the figure of 12 per
cent mentioned by Energy, Water and Telecommunications Minister Datuk
Seri Dr Lim Keng Yaik. The service, however, is patchy, sometimes slowing
down to the dog days of analogue dial-up. Many potential subscribers live
too far from the radius of coverage or haven't been able to get fixed
lines installed at all.
Dr Lim is unhappy with the state of affairs, blaming providers for
short-changing consumers on a dubiously ""best-effort"" basis instead of
actually supplying the megabits-per-second they boast of in their
advertisements. The ""last mile"" of the infrastructure has also not been
extensively laid, despite the handing out of licences to 12 telcos since
2003. These firms, says Dr Lim, have chosen to keep the dispensations
away as assets ""in a safe"", hoping for capital gains later on. He is
asking consumer groups to help pressure the telcos into keeping their
word.
The reason for the telcos' half-heartedness is the fear that the
Internet would cannibalise their businesses. That is, of course, true for
fixed-line telephony, where revenue growth has been starved by the mobile
networks and could go negative with the advent of VoIP, which allows
calls to be made anywhere in the world at the price of a local Internet
connection charge. Former monopolies such as Britain's BT have read the
writing on the wall and turned themselves from phone companies to
full-time Internet service providers. Telekom Malaysia is destined to
head the same way, but that still leaves the problem of laying the new
copper wiring now that margins are shrinking.
Profits from Internet connectivity can be improved with better services
and fee structures geared to usage. And not all the licensees are caught
in a chicken-and-egg situation. Dr Lim cited one company that has focused
on providing commercial broadband in the Silicon Valley of Penang,
thereby pre-empting the dilemma between voice and data that has plagued
its bigger counterparts. The ministry should revoke the licences of
non-performers and award them to those who can similarly walk the talk.

"Focus on reckless driving, not only on speeding cars
Source:New Straits Times
THE police seem to be going after those speeding on the highways as if
this will reduce the number of fatal accidents.
It is not speed that kills but driving dangerously or recklessly that
kills. There is a difference. A person who speeds may do so with great
care. He knows the capability of his vehicle and the condition of his mind
and road.
Everytime, I take the car out, I say a small prayer to save me from
people who seem to think that accidents will never happen to them. These
people will speed, tailgate and suddenly overtake you, on your left or
right, without honking at you or flashing their lights.
It is times like these that you wish there was some section in the
traffic laws enabling a person to report such ""mad"" drivers so that heavy
fines may be imposed on them.
Some time ago, it was suggested that division one officers report
dangerous drivers to the police for action. Is that still being practised?
It would be better if police could send out men on motorcycles or unmarked
cars and look out for these dangerous drivers. The expenses for these can
be easily recovered from the fines. There are so many such drivers that
they are just waiting to be caught.
And these are the drivers who are actually causing accidents.

"Lorry driver gets 30 months' jail for reckless driving
Source:New Straits Times
KOTA TINGGI, Fri. - A lorry driver was sentenced to 30 months' jail by the
magistrate's court here today for reckless driving resulting in the death
of four motorcyclists who were on a road safety campaign last year.
Halim Atan, 28, (right), whose jail term will commence today, also had
his driving licence suspended for a year.
In passing sentence magistrate Azmi Kari said the 10-metre long tyre
skid mark on the road surface where the accident occurred clearly showed
Halim had been driving the lorry recklessly.
The offence was committed at Km25 Jalan Johor Baru-Mersing at 4.05pm on
Aug 22 last year.
Halim was charged under section 41(1) of the Road Transport Act 1987
which carries a maximum fine of RM10,000 or five years' jail or both.
""Photographs taken at the scene showed there was indeed an element of
carelessness on the part of the lorry driver, whose reckless actions had
caused the death of the motorcyclists,"" he said.
Four bikers in a convoy of 145 motorcycles taking part in a Zero
Motorcycle Accident (Bikathon 2) from Mersing to Johor Baru were killed in
the crash.
Halim was the driver of the lorry which crashed into the rear of a
factory bus, which subsequently went out of control and ploughed into the
bikers.
Those killed in the accident were Deputy Superintendent of Police Hamzah
Kassim, 40, his wife Sharimah A. Rahim, 41, Mad Sani Lamad, 44, and Ellias
Lazim, 31.
Earlier in mitigation, Halim, who was unrepresented, appealed for a
light sentence saying he had a wife and two young children and aged
parents to support.
Prosecuting officer Inspector S. Rajakumar, however, pressed for a
deterrent sentence, adding that Halim was the main cause of the crash.
He described Halim as a dangerous, careless and ruthless driver who had
deliberately discarded warning signals from the convoy coming from the
opposite direction.
""He was speeding and reckless, and the skid marks on the road surface
are evidence of this. Even the bus driver and passengers in the bus were
thrown off their seats by the impact,"" he said.

"Reckless driving the main factor
Source:New Straits Times
THE festive season is just around the corner.
Like many other highways, the Segamat-Gambang Highway is a killer
stretch.
I have observed three main reasons for a very high number of accidents
on this stretch.
First is speeding. The 90kph limit set by the authority is mostly
ignored.
Most drivers have a tendency to speed but are not aware of the patches
and drops found on this highway.
Speedsters have been seen losing control of their vehicles and hitting
oncoming vehicles or skidding and hitting the trees flanking the road.
Second is the thoughtless act of overtaking other vehicles while
speeding.
Many drivers who speed lose control of their cars and crash into
oncoming vehicles.
Third is overloading. Most big vehicles are overloaded with heavy
materials such as logs and oil palm fruits.
Many vehicles are not road- worthy and choose to use the road at night.
The police and Road Transport Department officers are often seen
mounting operations on this highway to nab wrongdoers but this has not
deterred them.
The authorities should think of more severe measures. Heavier fines
should be imposed and vehicles that are not road-worthy impounded.
Drivers caught for speeding should be immediately tested for misuse of
drugs and drink driving - not necessarily only when a serious accident
has occurred.

The court can also suspend the licence of an offender for a minimum of

THE driver of a multi-purpose van that was involved in a fatal crash at
the North-South Expressway on Christmas eve was charged in a magistrate's
court yesterday with causing death by reckless and dangerous driving.
Staff nurse Angeline Jayarane Arunasalam, 44 (picture), who was overcome
with emotion, pleaded not guilty.
Angeline Jayarane was charged with driving the van, bearing registration
number PFP 9723, in a reckless and dangerous way, causing the death of:
* navy personnel Mohd Kamal Mamat, 48, who was the driver of a car, with
registration number WHB 7605, and two of its passengers, also navy staff,
Shahrul Hafizi Hashim, 28, and Noor Junaizah Zakaria, 25; and,
* Angeline Jayarane's husband James Michael, 45, and her son Steven
Jeyaseelan, 13, who were travelling with her in the van.
She allegedly committed the offence at Km425.2 of the North-South
Expressway, near Bukit Beruntung, about 1.25pm on Dec 24.
The offence is punishable with between two and 10 years' jail or a fine
between RM5,000 and RM20,000. The driver's licence, too, may be suspended
for three years.
Angeline Jayarane was weeping when she arrived at the courtroom about
9.30am with her relatives.
As the court interpreter was about to read the charge, she sobbed hard.
She then leaned forward against the dock, prompting a traffic police-
woman, who was sitting at the public gallery, to pull her back to the
bench in the dock.
When the interpreter finished reading the charge, she was in a bowing
position, still crying.
She, however, entered a notguilty plea when asked by the interpreter.
When the proceedings ended, she had to be helped by the policewoman and
her sister out of the dock.
Chief Inspector Zalina Idris had during the proceedings suggested a bail
of RM7,000 for Angeline Jayarane, saying that the road crash was a public
interest case.
Zalina also asked the court to suspend her driving licence.
Counsel Justine Morais, who asked for the bail to be reduced to RM2,000,
said his client was a nurse with 19 years of experience and now a staff
nurse at the Bukit Mertajam Hospital, which recently awarded her an
excellent service award.
He urged the court to take into account that her husband and son had
been killed in the crash.
Morais also said that Angeline Jayarane's brother-in-law, who is a
dentist, wanted to post bail and there was no possibility that she would
not attend hearing.
Magistrate Hashim Ibrahim, in setting bail at RM5,000 in one surety,

"JAPAN: HIT-AND-RUN ACCIDENT VICTIM IN OKINAWA DIES
NAHA, Japan, Oct 15 (Oana-Kyodo) - An 18-year-old high school girl, the
victim of a double hit-and-run accident in Okinawa prefecture last week,
died at a hospital in Okinawa last night, hospital officials said early
today.
Yuki Uema, a third-year student at Kitanakagusuku High School, died at
10:10 p.m. from injuries suffered in the road accident in the village of
Kitanakagusuku in Japan's southernmost prefecture.
The Naha district public prosecutors office took U.S. marine Randall
Eskridge, 23, into custody Tuesday after indicting him on charges of
drunken driving.
Eskridge is charged with seriously injuring Uema when his car allegedly
hit her motorcycle on a national road Oct. 7, investigators said. Another
car is suspected of then hitting Uema before it too drove off without
stopping.
Okinawa prefectural police served an arrest warrant on the suspect Oct.
8 and asked the U.S. marine corps in Okinawa to hand him over.
But the U.S. military refused to do so, saying that based on the
Japan-U.S. Status of Forces Agreement the case is not one in which the
suspect is required to be handed over before he is indicted.
Okinawa police carried out an additional probe and sent papers on the
serviceman to prosecutors Monday, thereupon Naha prosecutors indicted
Eskridge and took him into custody yesterday.
The 1995 agreement stipulates that an American suspect can be
transferred to Japanese authorities for pre-indictment investigation only
when the person is suspected of committing the ''heinous crimes of murder
or rape.''
The agreement was prompted in part by the abduction and rape of a
12-year-old girl by three U.S. servicemen in September that year.
The hit-and-run accident has intensified calls among Okinawans for a
reduction of the U.S. military presence in their prefecture.
In December 1996, the U.S. government promised to speed up the return
of land in Naha to Japan as part of a bilateral agreement to reduce and
consolidate U.S. military bases in Okinawa.
Immediately after the accident, U.S. Ambassador to Japan Thomas Foley
