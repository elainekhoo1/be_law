We also provide them with unparalleled growth and development opportunities. We can’t wait for you to discover this for yourself as a Tax Data Analyst on our Finance team in Bayan Lepas, Penang.
Dell is a global, multi-billion-dollar corporation, so our Tax team has a huge task in ensuring that we meet our tax obligations. It’s a wide-ranging area – from tax research, planning and compliance, through to developing and implementing systems to support data collection, analysis, preparation and submission. Whether preparing and completing tax returns and reports, catching up with the latest developments in tax law or answering enquiries from a host of internal and external customers, we’re always switched on and on top of our game.

We also provide them with unparalleled growth and development opportunities. We can’t wait for you to discover this for yourself as a Global Tax Automation Data/Support Senior Analyst on our Finance team in Malaysia.
Dell is a global, multi-billion-dollar corporation, so our Tax team has a huge task in ensuring that we meet our tax obligations. It’s a wide-ranging area – from tax research, planning and compliance, through to developing and implementing systems to support data collection, analysis, preparation and submission. Whether preparing and completing tax returns and reports, catching up with the latest developments in tax law or answering enquiries from a host of internal and external customers, we’re always switched on and on top of our game.
